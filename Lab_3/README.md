# Laboratory Assignment 3


## Problem Statement 
This assignment focuses on providing you hands-on experience with building a real time stock price 
analysis and algorithmic trading model. We will focus on data collection, storage and pre-processing to get 
your team ready to perform analysis and algorithmic trading on the stored data. 
In this lab, you will work with your team to design and implement functions that would dynamically fetch 
stock data using the finance API. Additionally, you'll explore different ways to efficiently store and quickly 
retrieve the data from the database.
