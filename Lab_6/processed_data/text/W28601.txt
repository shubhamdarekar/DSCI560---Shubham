INTRODUCTION

The Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC Chalmers Wade Federal 5301 44-24 12TXR [SE SE
Section 24, T153N, R101 W] is located approximately 30 miles south of Williston, North Dakota.
The horizontal well was spud on June 11th, 2014 and represents a continuation of Oasis
Petroleum’s development of the Three Forks Formation within Baker Field. The Chalmers Wade
Federal 5301 44-24 12TXR was planned to drill an approximately 9,985’ lateral along a
proposed azimuth of 94.3°. The well bore will be enhanced for production by multistage fracture
stimulation.

OFFSET CONTROL INFORMATION

The offset information can be found in the structure section of this report. The three offset wells
used are located on the same pad, and were the Oasis Chalmers 5301 44-24 3BR [SE SE Sec. 24,
T153N, R101W], the Oasis Chalmers 5301 44-24 2TR [SE SE Sec. 24, T153N, R101 W], the

GEOLOGIC EVALUATION
Methods:

Geologic supervision of the Chalmers Wade Federal 5301 44-24 12TXR was provided by
Sunburst Consulting, Inc. with two well site geologists. A digital gas detector and chromatograph
were interfaced with a Pason electronic data recorder system. The unit of measure for gas on this
well was units (u), which was defined as 100 units equaling 1% methane equivalent in air. The
EDR provided drill rate, on-off bottom and pump strokes to the gas detection computer and
received total gas information from Sunburst for viewing around location. Lagged samples were
caught by the rig crew in 30’ intervals from 8,200’ MD to 10,720’MD, 10’ intervals from
10,720’ MD to 11,500’ MD, and 30’ intervals from 11,500’ MD to 21,050’ TD. Wet and dry
cuttings were examined under a tri-ocular microscope and complete lithologic descriptions and
sampling intervals are provided in the lithology document within this evaluation. The set of dry
cuttings collected during the duration of the well were sent to the State of North Dakota.
Evidence of light hydrocarbons present in the drilling fluid was reported by the gas
chromatography equipment and documented on the mud log presented with this report.

Zones of Interest:

The Mission Canyon Formation (Mississippian; Madison Group) was drilled at 9,288’ TVD
(-7,320’) and is comprised largely of light gray lime mudstone followed by gray to tan earthy
textured argillaceous lime mudstone. Shows within the Mission Canyon ranged from 40 to 187
units against 10.0 ppg mud.

below the top of the Three Forks Formation. Directional tools were then pulled out of the
hole and a string of 7” casing was set (11,418’ MD) and then cemented by Schlumberger.

Samples from the target zone varied in porosity, oil staining, color, cementation, and pyrite
content. Stratigraphic location in the target zone was based on these sample observations
along with gas shows, drill rates and gamma ray values. Severe doglegs were to be avoided
so as to obtain the desired vertical section and aid in a successful completion liner run at TD.

The Oasis prospect geologist defined the an initial target zone as an 12’ zone that began 9’
below the top of the Three Forks Formation and at the claystone member, 21’ below the
Three Forks Formation. The target zone consisted of an upper dolomite and shale interval
reading 100-140 count gamma (A marker). The center of the target interval was comprised
of a warmer dolomite with greater amounts of shale reading 120-140 count gamma (B
marker). The base of the target zone was characterized by a clean dolomite with trace
amounts of shale with gamma readings of 40-100 (C marker). The A-C gamma markers were
used for determining depth within the target interval and plotted on the Chalmers Wade
Federal 5301 44-24 12TXR dip profile (Figure 10).

Figure 3 & 4: Wet cutting of the Lodgepole Formation (left) and False Bakken sub-interval (right) at 10X.

The top of the Lodgepole Formation was logged at 9,843’ TVD (-7,875’). In general the
Lodgepole can be described as a medium to dark gray brown argillaceous lime mudstone with a
crystalline texture and trace amounts of disseminated pyrite (Figure 3). The False Bakken
(Carrington Shale), drilled at 10,572’ TVD (-8,604’), is comprised of very dark brown to black,
slightly pyritic shale with an earthy texture, and was found to be soft to firm (Figure 4). Strong
hydrocarbon shows in the lower 100’ of the Lodgepole were as high as 140 total gas units;
suggest that some of the oil and gas from the Upper Bakken Shale may be exploiting fractures
thought to exist in the Lower Lodgepole.

The Bakken Formation (Devonian — Mississippian) has four formal members, an upper and
lower black, fissile, organic-rich pyritic shale, separated by an arenaceous limestone, siltstone
and silty sandstone middle member. These three members overlay a silty shale or siltstone of the
Pronghorn Member toward the basin depositional center. The Upper Bakken Shale was drilled at
10,584 TVD (-8,616’) with sample returns typically described as black, carbonaceous,
petroliferous shale with trace amounts of disseminated pyrite (Figure 5). The Middle Bakken,
penetrated at 10,599’ TVD (-8,631’), consists of a varying thickness and sequence of interbedded
siltstone, limestone and silty sandstone. Trace spotty light brown oil staining was present along
with gas shows as high as 899 TGU. This light brown spotty oil staining was common.
Penetrated at 10,649’ TVD (-8,681’), the Lower Bakken Shale was described as a black to dark
brown carbonaceous shale with trace amounts of disseminated pyrite (Figure 6). Gas shows
encountered in the Lower Bakken read as high as 1465u (C1-C4). The Pronghorn was penetrated
at 10,649 TVD (-8,681’) and is commonly described as a dark to medium gray siltstone with
calcite cement.

Figure 5 & 6: Wet cuttings of the Upper Bakken Shale (left), Lower Bakken Shale (right) at 10X.

The Three Forks Formation (Devonian; Kaskaskia Sequence) represents a regressive sequence
deposited in a supratidal sabkha environment. The top of the Three Forks was drilled at 10,669’
TVD (-8,701’) and is comprised of a light to medium gray, cream to off white sucrosic dolomite
with trace to occasional amounts of disseminated pyrite and light green shale also with trace
amounts of disseminated pyrite (Figure 8). Shows within the Three Forks Formation ranged from
50 to 2805 units in a drilling mud of 9.6-9.9 ppg.

Geo-steering:

Kick-off point for the curve was established from the isopach of the “base last salt” marker
to the Three Forks “target” in the offset wells. The Chalmers 5301 44-24 4T2R was used as
the primary offset through the vertical and curve sections. While drilling the curve, measured
gamma ray signatures were compared to those of the three offsets and aided in the landing of
the curve. The landing target was confirmed by the depth of the False Bakken, which was
consistent with the offset wells. While drilling the curve, the mud motor broke in half leaving
the bit and lower part of the motor in the hole. As a result, the curve was plugged and a
sidetrack was drilled. This initial sidetrack failed and resulted in the drilling of a successful
second sidetrack. The second sidetrack curve was successfully landed within the Three Forks
Formation at a depth of 11,451’ MD (10,684’ TVD) placing the well bore approximately 15’

were able to anticipate, and interpret the local apparent dip during the drilling of the
Chalmers Wade Federal 5301 44-24 12TXR well. A total depth of 21,050’ MD was reached
on August 22, 2014 at 13:48 CDT. The target resultant was 100% within the Three Forks
Formation. The resulting structure of the Three Forks was a fall in TVD of 69’ over 10,150”
MD; resulting in an overall down dip of 0.39° as portrayed on the Chalmers Wade Federal
5301 44-24 12TXR dip profile (Figure 10).

Hydrocarbons:

Gas monitoring and fluid gains were monitored to evaluate the viability of this reservoir
during the drilling of the Chalmers Wade Federal 5301 44-24 12TXR well. In the invert mud
system, hydrostatic conditions were maintained near balance. This allowed for gas and fluid
gains from the well to be monitored. Gas shows were encountered in vertical, curve and
lateral drilling of the well.

Background gas observed during the drilling of the lateral ranged from 60 to 1200 units.
Invert drilling fluid was used throughout the drilling of the vertical and curve weighing 10.0-
10.8 ppg. The lateral was drilled with saline drilling fluid with a mud weight of 9.6-9.7 ppg.
Gas shows ranged up to 2250 units and connection gases were observed up to 3700 units.
C1-C4 gas components were observed throughout the course of the lateral. Trip gases were
observed as high as 3,671 units. Oil shows were very light throughout the lateral ranging

SUMMARY

The Nabors B25 drilling rig successfully drilled a 9,599’ two-section horizontal well bore
within the Three Forks Formation at the Chalmers Wade Federal 5301 44-24 12TXR. A mud
program consisting of diesel invert (10.0—10.8 ppg), during the vertical, first sidetrack curve,
and second sidetrack curve build sections, and saline based mud (9.6-9.70 ppg), during the
lateral maintained stable hole conditions and permitted adequate analysis of gas
concentrations.

Projections of dip were successfully used to maintain the well bore in the Three Forks
Formation target for 81% of the lateral. Samples from the target consisted of a light to
medium gray, cream to off white dolomite with trace to occasional amounts of disseminated
pyrite and light green shale also with trace amounts of disseminated pyrite. Intercrystalline
porosity was generally seen throughout the entire lateral. Hydrocarbon shows in the target
zone were high throughout the lateral. Samples from the ideal zone contained a spotty light
brown oil stain.

The Chalmers Wade Federal 5301 44-24 12TXR will be fitted with a 4 %” production liner
and swell packers in preparation for a fracture stimulation that will determine the true
commercial value of the well. The well currently awaits fracture stimulation.

LITHOLOGY

Rig crews caught lagged samples in 30’ intervals under the supervision of Sunburst geologists. A detailed list of
sampling intervals is included in the well data summary page. Sample or gamma ray marker tops have been inserted
in the sample descriptions below for reference. Samples were examined wet and dry under a trinocular microscope.
The drilling fluid was diesel-based invert from surface casing to intermediate casing, while salt water drilling fluid
was used throughout the lateral. Sample collection began at 8,200’ MD.

RE: HORIZONTAL WELL
CHALMERS WADE FEDERAL 5301 44-24 12TXR
SESE Section 24-153N-101W
McKenzie County
Well File # 28601

Dear Heather:

Pursuant to Commission Order No. 23752, approval to drill the above captioned well is hereby given. The
approval is granted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be located
approximately down the east-west axis of the spacing unit (within 250’ of the section line per Commission policy)
and no closer than the 200! setback from the east & west boundaries within the 2560 acre spacing unit consisting
of Sections 19, 20, 29, & 30 T153N R100W.

PERMIT STIPULATIONS: Effective June 1, 2014, a covered leak-proof container (with placard) for
filter sock disposal must be maintained on the well site beginning when the well is spud, and must
remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations are
conducted. In cases where a spacing unit is accessed from an off-site drill pad, an affidavit must be
provided affirming that the surface owner of the multi-well pad agrees to accept burial on their property
of the cuttings generated from drilling the well(s) into an offsite spacing/drilling unit. DUE TO
STREAM ADJACENT TO THE WELL SITE, A DIKE IS REQUIRED SURROUNDING THE
ENTIRE LOCATION. OASIS PETRO NO AMER must contact NDIC Field Inspector Richard Dunn
at 701-770-3554 prior to setting conductor.

Drilling pit

NDAC 43-02-03-19.4 states that “a pit may be utilized to bury drill cuttings and solids generated during well
drilling and completion operations, providing the pit can be constructed, used and reclaimed in a manner that will
prevent pollution of the land surface and freshwaters. Reserve and circulation of mud system through earthen pits
are prohibited. All pits shall be inspected by an authorized representative of the director prior to lining and use.
Drill cuttings and solids must be stabilized in a manner approved by the director prior to placement in a cuttings

pit.”

Form 1 Changes & Hard Lines

Any changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC.
The proposed directional plan is at a legal location. The minimum legal coordinates from the well head at casing
point are: 594’ south and 445’ east. Also, based on the azimuth of the proposed lateral the maximum legal
coordinate from the well head is: 10558’ east.

Location Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period)

Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the
approved drilling permit on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report. If circumstances require operations to
commence before the 3rd business day following publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may
be waived by the Director. Application for a waiver must be by sworn affidavit providing the information
necessary to evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f, and any other
information that would allow the Director to conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the
drilling permit, the applicant should retain the permit.

Permit Fee & Notification

Payment was received in the amount of $100 via credit card .The permit fee has been received. It is requested
that notification be given immediately upon the spudding of the well. This information should be relayed to the
Oil & Gas Division, Bismarck, via telephone. The following information must be included: Well name, legal
location, permit number, drilling contractor, company representative, date and time of spudding. Office hours are
8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. Central Time. Our telephone number is (701) 328-8020, leave a
message if after hours or on the weekend.

Survey Requirements for Horizontal, Horizontal Re-entry, and Directional Wells

NDAC Section 43-02-03-25 (Deviation Tests and Directional Surveys) states in part (that) the survey contractor
shall file a certified copy of all surveys with the director free of charge within thirty days of completion. Surveys
must be submitted as one electronic copy, or in a form approved by the director. However, the director may
require the directional survey to be filed immediately after completion if the survey is needed to conduct the
operation of the director's office in a timely manner. Certified surveys must be submitted via email in one adobe
document, with a certification cover page to certsurvey@nd.gov.
Survey points shall be of such frequency to accurately determine the entire location of the well bore.
Specifically, the Horizontal and Directional well survey frequency is 100 feet in the vertical, 30 feet in the curve
(or when sliding) and 90 feet in the lateral.

Surface casing cement

Tail cement utilized on surface casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi within 12
hours, and tail cement utilized on production casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi
before drilling the plug or initiating tests.

Logs

NDAC Section 43-02-03-31 requires the running of (1) a suite of open hole logs from which formation tops and
porosity zones can be determined, (2) a Gamma Ray Log run from total depth to ground level elevation of the well bore, and
(3) a log from which the presence and quality of cement can be determined (Standard CBL or Ultrasonic cement evaluation
log) in every well in which production or intermediate casing has been set, this log must be run prior to completing the well.
All logs run must be submitted free of charge, as one digital TIFF (tagged image file format) copy and one digital LAS (log

DETAILS OF WORK

Oasis Petroleum North America LLC requests permission for suspension of drilling for up to 90 days for the
referenced well under NDAC 43-02-03-55. Oasis Petroleum North America LLC intends to drill the surface hole with
freshwater based drilling mud and set surface casing with a small drilling rig and move off within 3 to 5 days. The
casing will be set at a depth pre-approved by the NDIC per the Application for Permit to Drill NDAC 43-02-03-21. No
saltwater will be used in the drilling and cementing operations of the surface casing. Once the surface casing is
cemented, a plug or mechanical seal will be placed at the top of the casing to prevent any foreign matter from getting
into the well. A rig capable of drilling to TD will move onto the location within the 90 days previously outlined to
complete the drilling and casing plan as per the APD. The undersigned states that this request for suspension of
drilling operations in accordance with the Subsection 4 of Section 43-02-03-55 of the NDACG, is being requested to
take advantage of the cost savings and time savings of using an initial rig that is smaller than the rig necessary to
drill a well to total depth but is not intended to alter or extend the terms and conditions of, or suspend any obligation
under, any oil and gas lease with acreage in or under the spacing or drilling unit for the above-referenced well. Oasis
Petroleum North America LLC understands NDAC 43-02-03-31 requirements regarding confidentiality pertaining to
this permit. The drilling pit will be fenced immediately after construction if the well pad is located in a pasture (NDAC
43-02-03-19 & 19.1). Oasis Petroleum North America LL will plug and abandon the well and reclaim the well site if the
well is not drilled by the larger rotary rig within 90 days after spudding the well with the smaller drilling rig.

RE: Filter Socks and Other Filter Media
Leakproof Container Required
Oil and Gas Wells

Dear Operator,

North Dakota Administrative Code Section 43-02-03-19.2 states in part that all waste material associated with
exploration or production of oil and gas must be properly disposed of in an authorized facility in accord with all
applicable local, state, and federal laws and regulations.

Filtration systems are commonly used during oil and gas operations in North Dakota. The Commission is very
concerned about the proper disposal of used filters (including filter socks) used by the oil and gas industry.

Effective June 1, 2014, a container must be maintained on each well drilled in North Dakota beginning when the
well is spud and must remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations
are conducted. The on-site container must be used to store filters until they can be properly disposed of in an
authorized facility. Such containers must be:

e leakproof to prevent any fluids from escaping the container

e covered to prevent precipitation from entering the container

e placard to indicate only filters are to be placed in the container

If the operator will not utilize a filtration system, a waiver to the container requirement will be considered, but
only upon the operator submitting a Sundry Notice (Form 4) justifying their request.

As previously stated in our March 13, 2014 letter, North Dakota Administrative Code Section 33-20-02.1-01
states in part that every person who transports solid waste (which includes oil and gas exploration and production
wastes) is required to have a valid permit issued by the North Dakota Department of Health, Division of Waste
Management. Please contact the Division of Waste Management at (701) 328-5166 with any questions on the
solid waste program. Note oil and gas exploration and production wastes include produced water, drilling mud,
invert mud, tank bottom sediment, pipe scale, filters, and fly ash.

Thank you for your cooperation.

Sincerely,

Brace E. Fichs
