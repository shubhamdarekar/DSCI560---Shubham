Synopsis

Oasis Petroleum North America LLC Chalmers 5300 31-19H [NW SW Section 19, T153N,
R100W] is located ~5.7 miles South of the town of Williston, North Dakota. Chalmers 5300 31-
19H is situated within a Wildcat Field in McKenzie County. A single lateral leg trending 90° was
proposed to be drilled from the NW SW corner of Section 29 to the NE SW corner of Section 20
targeting the porous silty sandstone of the middle member of the Bakken Formation,
approximately 10 - 20’ below the top of the Upper Bakken Shale.

Geologic Assessment

Methods

Geologic supervision of Chalmers 5300 31-19H was provided by two experienced RPM well site
geologists. Gas and chromatograph levels were measured using iBall Instruments Bloodhound™
real time gas detector and chromatograph system. The Bloodhound gas detection system uses
non-dispersive infrared and chemical sensor gas detection to evaluate gases liberated from the
formation by the drill bit and carried to the surface by the drilling fluid.

The Bloodhound was interfaced with a Canrig electronic data recorder system. Canrig provided
drill rate, on-off bottom and pump strokes to the Bloodhound and received total gas information
from the Bloodhound for viewing on location and remotely.

Under the direction of RPM well site geologist, rig crews were instructed to catch lagged drill
cutting samples at 30’ intervals from 8,120’ throughout the curve and lateral section.

Sampled drill cuttings were examined wet and dry under a binocular microscope using both plain
(broad spectrum) and transmitted light. Cuttings were evaluated for hydrocarbon “cut” by
immersion in EnTron-AE and inspection under a UV fluoroscope. 10% hydrochloric acid and
alizarin red were used to determine the calcareous and dolomitic content of rocks and cementing.

RPM Consulting, Inc. (RPM) well site geologists also closely examined MWD gamma-ray
information and penetration rates to aid in steering decisions and dip degree estimations,

Vertical Operations

Overview

The Chalmers 5300 31-19H was spud for surface drilling on 1 September 2011, however the
Nabors 149 drilling rig didn’t actually spud until 4 October 2011. Prior to commencement of
RPM mud logging services, a 13 1/2” hole was drilled with fresh water to depth of 1,915’ and
isolated with 9 5/8” 36# J-55 casing cemented to surface.

RPM well site geologists began logging the vertical section at 8,120’.

One PDC bit was used to drill out of surface casing to vertical TD. Bit #2 (8 %” Smith MDSi
616) PDC was used to drill from 1,915’ to 9,948’ and averaged an ROP of 95.6 ft/hr in 84 hours
of use

Diesel invert drilling fluid with a mud weight ranging from 9.7-10.3 ppg was used for the
remainder of the vertical hole and in the curve builds sections. The vertical section was drilled to
a kick off point (KOP) of 9,948’, at which point vertical operations were ceased.


Control Wells

Two completed wells were used as control offsets on Chalmers 5300 31-19H.

The Wade Federal 5300 21-30H [SW NW Section 30, T153N, R100W] is a horizontal well drilled by Oasis
Petroleum North America, LLC. It was spud 5 April 2011 and drilled to a total depth of 20,482’ into the
Middle Bakken Formation. Wade Federal 5300 21-30H is located approximately 0.7 miles South of
Chalmers 5300 31-19H. It is still operated by Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC.

The Kline Federal 5300 11-18H [NW NW Section 18, T153N, R100W] is a horizontal well drilled by Oasis
Petroleum North America, LLC. It was spud 7 May 2011 and drilled to a total depth of 20,650 into the
Middle Bakken Formation. Kline Federal 5300 11-18H is located approximately 1.5 miles North of
Chalmers 5300 31-19H. It is still operated by Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC.

During the curve, the gamma ray that was produced was constantly compared to the Wade Federal 5300 21-
30H and Kline Federal 5300 11-18H wells. Gamma ray was used to help determine a proper landing depth.

To assist in the choosing of an initial target, an isopach table (Table 1) was constructed to
measure the distance of formation tops to the target depth determined from the offset well.
Comparison of gamma ray markers showed the most consistent isopach for up hole formations to
be the Base of Charles Salt.

Directional Operations

RPM provided equipment and personnel for directional services. Ryan Energy Technologies
(Ryan) provided equipment and personnel for MWD services. RPM geologists worked closely
with RPM directional and Ryan MWD teams to formulate steering decisions to maximize the
footage of borehole in the pay zone.

Curve Build

Overview

Bit #3 was an 8 %” Security DBS used in front of a 2.30° fixed mud motor to drill the curve from
measured depth 9,948’ to 10,906’ in 33 hours, averaging 29 fi/hr.

A Chart was constructed for the curve (Chart 1) that compared the isopach of certain easily
recognizable gamma markers From the Base of Charles Salt to Middle Bakken Formation on
the two control wells. This chart was used to determine which gamma markers had the closest
isopach thicknesses to the target and therefore the highest confidence in their use to land the
curve. The curve was completed at a measured depth of 10,906’and TVD of ~ 10,593’, ~ 10’
below the Upper Bakken Shale.

Figure 5: Photograph sample from the Upper Bakken Shale.

The Middle Member of the Bakken Formation was penetrated at 11,806’ MD, (10,853’ TVD)
(-8,654’), 30” low to the Wade Federal 5300 21-30H well. The upper zone of the middle member

contained a light grey siltstone with little or no oil stain or visible porosity (Figure 6). Samples
from the top of the Middle member were described as:

SILTSTONE: gray to brown, very fine grained, firm to friable, sub rounded to sub
angular, vitreous, slight to not calcareous, well sorted, poorly cemented, trace
disseminated pyrite, trace patchy oil stain, trace intergranular porosity

Lithology

The top of the “False Bakken” was penetrated at a measured depth of 10,696’ (TVD 10,550’) (-
8,621’) suggesting a target depth of 10,590’ TVD.

The Upper Shale of the Bakken Formation [Missippian — Devonian] was drilled at 10,736’
(10,566’ TVD) (-8,637’) with sample returns of black, carbonaceous, and petroliferous shale
(Figure 5) characterized by gamma ray values in excess of 255 API counts. Gas levels rose
sharply through the Upper Shale, increasing from a background of ~400 units to over 1300 units,
and then receded to ~830 units.

Samples were described as:

SHALE: very dark gray to brown, sub blocky to blocky, friable to firm, smooth hard,
waxy texture, calcareous, occasional disseminated pyrite, no visible oil stain

Lateral
Overview

Drilling fluid consisting of open system salt water brine (9.9 to 10.3 ppg) was substituted for
diesel invert while drilling the lateral section. One 6” PDC bit was used to drill the lateral.

Bit #4 (6” Smith MDi 613), was a PDC bit used to drill the entire lateral from 10,906’ to
20,300’. The total of 9,394’ was drilled in 120.5 hours for an average rate of penetration of 78.0
ft/hr.

At 0400 hours on 15 October 11, the Upper Bakken Shale was penetrated during horizontal
drilling operations at a bottom hole location of 62.66’ S and 2,803.34’ E of surface location,
approximately 1,472.34’ FSL and 3,178.34’ FWL NE SW Sec. 19, T153N, R100W, and forced
the decision to sidetrack at 13,000’.

After a successful sidetrack, drilling operations were concluded at 0300 hours on 20 October 11
at a bottom hole location of 134,577 N & 9,825.31' E of surface location or approximately
1,669.57’ FSL & 313.06’ FEL NE SE Sec. 20 T153N, R100W.

Lithology

To aid in communications while drilling the lateral, a type log was created using the gamma
signature from the Verlin Fossum 26-1 well in Sec, 26, T153N, R101W (Diagram 1). The target
zone was an area between the red lines on chart 1. The goal was to keep the well bore in this
region for as much of the drilling operations as possible.

The Middle Member of the Bakken Formation consisted of 2 primary facies. The upper most
was the light gray siltstone seen while landing the curve and described above. The second was
silty sandstone that was characterized by a light to medium gray color, calcitic to dolomitic
cementing and patchy oil staining (Figure 7). Samples from this vertical region of the middle
member were generally described as:

SILTY SANDSTONE: light to medium gray, very fine grained, sub angular, firm to
friable, moderately sorted, calcareous cement, occasional nodular and disseminated
pyrite, trace intergranular porosity, possible fracture porosity, fast abundant white
streaming cut, strong cream to white diffuse cut

Gas and hydrocarbon Shows

Total gas levels were recorded with an average background of ~ 100-400 units while drilling the
Lodgepole Formation through most of the curve. Upon penetrating the Bakken Formation the
total gas units immediately increased to over 1000 units, reaching a peak of 1,334 units, The
amount of total gas began to gradually decrease to about 500 units by the casing point at 10,906’
MD.

Upon exiting casing, total gas levels picked up to an average of 1500 units and gradually
increased to an average of 3000 units by the end of the lateral.

As the bit moved through the target zone of the Middle Member of the Bakken Formation total
gas levels gradually rose from 2800u to over 3300u until the bit began to drop near the bottom of
the target zone, at which point gas levels dropped as low as 1010 units. The Bloodhound gas
chromatograph showed components of all C1-C4 present through the entire lateral (Figure 8). A
3-5’ flare was maintained at the flare stack intermittently through the lateral, whenever gas levels
exceeded about 3000 units. Abundant oil began to wash out of the samples at about 11,800’ and
continued to wash out throughout the lateral, except where the well bore dropped below the
target zone.

The Chalmer 5300 31-19H was initially spud for surface drilling on 1 September 2011 in
a Wildcat Field of McKenzie County, North Dakota. The well was spud by Nabors 149
on 4 October 2011. The vertical hole was drilled to a total depth (KOP) of 10,906’.

A mud program consisted of diesel invert (9.7 — 10.3 ppg) after surface casing and
through the curve build sections. Brine water with a weight of 9.9 to 10.3 ppg was used
during lateral drilling operations to maintain hydrostatic balance.

A 13 %” bit was used to drill to a depth of 1,915’. Two 8 %” Smith PDC bits were used
to drill out of surface casing to the KOP. Bit #1 drilled from a depth of 1,915’ to 9,948’,
while Bit #2 drilled from 9,948’ to 10,906’. The entire 10,352’ lateral was drilled in
120.5 hours with one 6” Smith PDC bit.

Gas levels between 2800 and 3400 units were maintained through most of the lateral
drilling operations.

The Middle Bakken consisted of two observed gross lithologies. Directly below the
upper Bakken Shale a light gray siltstone was observed. Below this siltstone, silty
sandstone ranging in colors from light to medium gray with occasional light tan to off
white color to a medium to dark gray was well sorted and very fine grained. The target
zone was comprised entirely of this silty sandstone.

A 3 to 5 foot flare was present intermittently at the stack through the lateral drilling
operation.

Abundant oil began washing out of the sample from a measured depth of approximately
11,800’ until TD at 20,300’, except where the well bore dipped below the bottom of the
target zone.

The Upper Bakken Shale was penetrated during horizontal drilling operations at a bottom
hole location of 62.66’ S and 2,803.34’ E of surface location, approximately 1,472.34’
FSL and 3,178.34" FWL NE SW Sec. 19, T153N, R100W, and forced the decision to
sidetrack at 13,000’.

Drilling operations were concluded at 0300 hours on 20 October 11 at a bottom hole
location of 134.57’ N & 9,825.31' E of surface location or approximately 1,669.57' FSL
& 313.06' FEL NE SE Sec. 20 T153N, R100W.

10) Oasis Petroleum Chalmers 5300 31-19H awaits completion operations to determine its

ultimate production potential.

LITHOLOGY

Rig crews caught lagged samples in 30’ intervals in the vertical hole from 8,120 to 10,700’ MD and
10,840’ to TD (20,300’). 10’ Samples were collected in the curve from 10,700 to 10,840’

Electric geophysical log, sample and/or MWD gamma ray markers and tops are included in the sample
descriptions below for reference. Samples were examined wet and dry under a binocular microscope in
approximately 30’ intervals. Sample descriptions begin just above the Kibbey Lime Formation. The
drilling fluid was diesel invert during vertical and curve build sections and ICP, and salt water brine
throughout the lateral to TD.

DETAILS OF WORK

Oasis Petroleum North America LLC requests a waiver from the tubing/pkr requirement included in

NDAC 43-02-03-21: Casing, tubing, and cementing requirements during the completion period immediately
following the upcoming fracture stimulation.

The following assurances apply:

. The well is equipped with new 29# & 32# casing at surface with an API burst rating of 11,220 psi

. The frac design will use a safety factor of 0.85 API burst rating to determine the maximum pressure.

. Damage to the casing during the frac would be detected immediately by monitoring equipment.

. The casing is exposed to significantly lower rates and pressures during flow back than during the frac job.
. The frac fluid and formation fluids have very low corrosion and erosion rates.

. Production equipment will be installed as soon as possible after the well ceases flowing.

. A 300# gauge will be installed on the surface casing during the flowback period.

DETAILS OF WORK
Oasis requests permission for suspension of drilling for up to 90 days for the referenced well under NDAC 43-02-03-
55. Oasis intends to drill the surface hole with freshwater based drilling mud and set surface casing with a small
drilling rig and move off within 3 to 5 days. The casing will be set at a depth pre-approved by the NDIC per the
Application for Permit to Drill NDAC 43-02-03-21. No saltwater will be used in the drilling and cementing operations of
the surface casing. Once the surface casing is cemented, a plug or mechanical seal will be placed at the top of the
casing to prevent any foreign matter from getting into the well. A rig capable of drilling to TD will move onto the
location within the 90 days previously outlined to complete the drilling and casing plan as per the APD. The
undersigned states that this request for suspension of drilling operations in accordance with the Subsection 4 of
Section 43-02-03-55 of the NDAC, is being requested to take advantage of the cost savings and time savings of using
an initial rig that is smaller than the rig necessary to drill a well to total depth but is not intended to alter or extend the
terms and conditions of, or suspend any obligation under, any oil and gas lease with acreage in or under the spacing
or drilling unit for the above-referenced well. Oasis understands NDAC 43-02-03-31 requirements regarding
confidentiality pertaining to this permit. The lined reserve pit will be fenced immediately after construction if the well
pad is located in a pasture (NDAC 43-02-03-19 & 19.1). Oasis will plug and abandon the well and reclaim the well site if
the well is not drilled by the larger rotary rig within 90 days after spudding the well with the smaller drilling rig.

Survey Requirements for Horizontal, Horizontal Re-entry, and Directional Wells

NDAC Section 43-02-03-25 (Deviation Tests and Directional Surveys) states in part (that) the survey contractor
shall file a certified copy of all surveys with the director free of charge within thirty days of completion. Surveys
must be submitted as one electronic copy, or in a form approved by the director. However, the director may
require the directional survey to be filed immediately after completion if the survey is needed to conduct the
operation of the director's office in a timely manner. Certified surveys must be submitted via email in one adobe
document, with a certification cover page to certsurvey@nd.gov.
Survey points shall be of such frequency to accurately determine the entire location of the well bore.

Reserve pit
Please be advised that conditions may be imposed on the use and reclamation of a drilling reserve pit on
this site if specific site conditions warrant.

Surface casing cement

Tail cement utilized on surface casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi within 12
hours, and tail cement utilized on production casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi
before drilling the plug or initiating tests.

Logs

NDAC Section 43-02-03-31 requires the running of a Cement Bond Log from which the presence of
cement can be determined in every well in which production or intermediate casing has been set and a Gamma
Ray Log must be run from total depth to ground level elevation of the well bore. All logs must be submitted as
one paper copy and one digital copy in LAS (Log ASCII) format, or a format approved by the Director. Image
logs that include, but are not limited to, Mud Logs, Cement Bond Logs, and Cyberlook Logs, cannot be produced
in their entirety as LAS (Log ASCI)) files. To create a solution and establish a standard format for industry to
follow when submitting image logs, the Director has given approval for the operator to submit an image log as a
TIFF (*.tif) formatted file. The TIFF (*.tif) format will be accepted only when the log cannot be produced in its
entirety as a LAS (Log ASCII) file format. The digital copy may be submitted on a 3.5” floppy diskette, a standard
CD, or attached to an email sent to digitallogs@nd.gov

Thank you for your cooperation.

Pursuant to Commission Order No. 14638, approval to drill the above captioned well is hereby given. The
approval is granted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than
the 1220' setback (per Commission policy) from the north & south boundaries and 200' setback from the east &
west boundaries within the 1280 acre drilling unit consisting of Section 19 & 20 T153N R100W.

PERMIT STIPULATIONS: OASIS PETRO NO AMER must contact NDIC Field Inspector Kevin
Connors at 701-220-5989 prior to location construction.

NOTE: A Gamma Ray log must be run to ground surface and a CBL must be run on intermediate or longstring casing string if set.

NOTE: Intermediate or longstring casing string must be cemented above the top Dakota Group Sand.

Surveys are required at least every 30 feet in the build section and every 90 feet in the lateral section of a horizontal well. Measurement
inaccuracies are not considered when determining compliance with the spacing/drilling unit boundary setback requirement except in the
following scenarios: 1) When the angle between the well bore and the respective boundary is 10 degrees or less and the well bore is within
150 feet of the respective setback requirement; or 2) If industry standard methods and equipment are not utilized. Consult the applicable field
order for exceptions.

If measurement inaccuracies are required to be considered, a 2° MWD measurement inaccuracy will be applied to the horizontal portion of the well
bore. This measurement inaccuracy is applied to the well bore from KOP to TD.

REQUIRED ATTACHMENTS: Certified surveyor's plat, horizontal section plat, estimated geological tops, proposed mud/cementing plan,
