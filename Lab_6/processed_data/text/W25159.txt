OKLAHOMA CITY, OK 73126

RE: North Dakota Administrative Code (NDAC) Section 43-02-03-49
Perimeter Berm Requirement

NDIC# Please see attached list of 103 Facilities

Dear Bob Sandbo:

Please be advised that the attached list of facilities require a perimeter berm to be constructed within 180 days of
this notice because they have:

1. Storage tanks;
2. Daily throughput of more than one hundred barrels of fluid per day; and
3. Includes production equipment or load lines that are not contained within secondary containment dikes

The berm must be at least six inches in height, constructed of sufficiently impermeable material to provide
emergency containment, and must be maintained until the facility is either granted a waiver or the site is
reclaimed.

Pursuant to NDAC Section 43-02-03-49 - Within one hundred eighty days from the date the operator is notified by
the Commission, a perimeter berm, at least six inches in height, must be constructed of sufficiently impermeable
material to provide emergency containment and to divert surface drainage away from the site around all storage
facilities and production sites that include storage tanks, have a daily throughput of more than one hundred
barrels of fluid per day, and include production equipment or load lines that are not contained within secondary
containment dikes. The Director may consider an extension of time to implement these requirements if
conditions prevent timely construction, or modification of these requirements if other factors are present that
provide sufficient protection from environmental impacts.

This perimeter berm requirement may be modified or waived if the operator can demonstrate that other factors
are present that provide sufficient protection from environmental impacts. A Sundry Notice (Form 4) outlining any
engineering controls or other factors must be submitted to the Commission for approval of this modification or
waiver. Should you have any questions regarding this matter, feel free to contact me at 701-770-3554,

Sincerely,

Field Inspector

GEOLOGICAL SUMMARY & CONCLUSIONS

Continental Resources, Inc drilled the Columbus Federal 2-16H in Sections 16, 9, and 4 of
Township 153N, Range 101W into the First Bench of the Three Forks. The Well was spud using
Cyclone 4 on October 25, 2013 at a surface location of 2508' FNL, and 222' FEL.

The surface was pre-drilled with surface casing set at 1965'MD. From there the 8 3/4" vertical
portion was drilled to Kick Off Point (KOP) at 10135'MD. Leam provided Directional Drilling,
and Measurement While Drilling (MWD) services. NorAm Wellsite Services provided both Mud
Logging and Geosteering Services. No trips were necessary in the vertical.

The curve was drilled in 23.5 hours October 28-29, 2013. The wellbore entered the Three Forks
top at 10726'MD, 10568'TVD, and landed 18' into the First Bench at 10877'MD, 10586'TVD.

The Lateral began December 2, 2013 at 18:45 hours. Drilling north under the river, formation
took a dive down, as the wellbore struck the Lower Bakken Silt/Pronghorn calcareous shale.
Cyclone 4 pulled back to 12560'MD to begin Sidetrack 1 on December 4th, 2013 at 10:00 hours.
The first and only trip occurred at 16299'MD for a new Bit and Motor on December 7th, 2013 at
20:30 hours, and resumed drilling December 8th, 2013 at 17:52 hours.

The Columbus Federal 2-16 reached TD of 23,475'MD at 13:13 hours on December 13, 2013.
The Columbus Federal 2-16H bottom hole location is 236.1' FNL & 1348.94' FEL Section 4,
T153N, R1O1W.

DETAILS OF WORK

During the cement Job on the Columbus Federal 2-16H, returns were lost after dropping the plug. Returns resumed
temporarily but then became very low. Cement was not returned to surface. A CBL was scheduled the morning of

Thursday, August 15th, and indicated the top of cement to be at approximately 500’. Cement will be brought to
surface on the intermediate casing string.

“A 1” top job was performed. We got 1” pipe 180’ deep. We got cement to surface and continued pumping and then
staging to make sure the cement would not drop.”

*The Operator is to maintain a pressure gauge on the 9-5/8” X 7” annulus for continuous monitoring
and to report any pressure development or pressure management events.

DETAILS OF WORK

Continental Resources, Inc. requests permission for suspension of drilling for up to 90 days for the referenced well
under NDAC 43-02-03-55. Continental Resources, Inc. intends to drill the surface hole with freshwater based drilling
mud and set surface casing with a small drilling rig and move off within 3 to 5 days. The casing will be set at a depth
pre-approved by the NDIC per the Application for Permit to Drill NDAC 43-02-03-21. No saltwater will be used in the
drilling and cementing operations of the surface casing. Once the surface casing Is cemented, a plug or mechanical
seal will be placed at the top of the casing to prevent any foreign matter from getting into the well. A rig capable of
drilling to TD will move onto the location within the 90 days previously outlined to complete the drilling and casing
plan as per the APD. The undersigned states that thls request for suspension of drilling operations in accordance
with the Subsection 4 of Section 43-02-03-55 of the NDAC, is being requested to take advantage of the cost savings
and time savings of using an initial rig that is smaller than the rig necessary to drill a well to total depth but is not
intended to alter or extend the terms and conditions of, or suspend any obligation under, any oil and gas lease with
acreage in or under the spacing or drilling unit for the above-referenced well. Continental Resources, Inc.
understands NDAC 43-02-03-31 requirements regarding confidentiality pertaining to this permit. The drilling pit will
be fenced immediately after construction if the well pad Is located in a pasture (NDAC 43-02-03-19 & 19.1).
Continental Resources, Inc. will plug and abandon the well and reclaim the well site if the well Is not drilled by the
larger rotary rig within 90 days after spudding the well with the smaller drilling rig.

RE: HORIZONTAL WELL
COLUMBUS FEDERAL 2-16H
SENE Section 16-153N-101W
McKenzie County
Well File # 25159

Deat Terry:

Pursuant to Commission Order No. 21551, approval to drill the above captioned well is hereby given. The approval is granted on
the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than the 200' setback from the north & south
boundaries and 500' setback from the east & west boundaries within the 2560 acre spacing unit consisting of Sections 4, 9, 16, & 21-
T153N-R101W. Tool error is not required pursuant to order.

PERMIT STIPULATIONS: Due to surficial water adjacent to the well site, a dike is required surrounding the entire location.
A LINER MUST BE PLACED UNDER THE LOCATION. The MOUSE AND RAT HOLE MUST BE CEMENTED. A
spill contingency plan must be in place prior to spudding the wells. No Drilling Pit will be allowed. Continental must drill the
Columbus Federal 2-16H, 3-16H and Tallahassee 2-16H, 3-16H back to back. One horizontal well shall be drilled and
completed in the standup 1280-acre spacing unit described as Sections 4 and 9, T153N-R101W, McKenzie County, north
Dakota, prior to completing any horizontal well in the 2560-acre spacing unit described as Sections 4, 9, 16, and 21-T153N-
R101W McKenzie County, North Dakota. CONTINENTAL RESOURCES must contact NDIC Field Inspector Richard Dunn
at 701-770-3554 prior to location construction.

Drilling pit

NDAC 43-02-03-19.4 states that “a pit may be utilized to bury drill cuttings and solids generated during well drilling and completion
operations, providing the pit can be constructed, used and reclaimed in a manner that will prevent pollution of the land surface and
freshwaters. Reserve and circulation of mud system through earthen pits are prohibited. All pits shall be inspected by an authorized
representative of the director prior to lining and use. Drill cuttings and solids must be stabilized in a manner approved by the director
prior to placement in a cuttings pit.”

Form 1 Changes & Hard Lines

Any changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC. The proposed directional
plan is at a legal location. The minimum legal coordinate from the well head at casing point is: 278’ W. Also, based on the azimuth of the
proposed lateral the maximum legal coordinate from the well head is: 12755’ N and a minimum legal coordinate from the well head of 278’
W.

Location Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period)

Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the approved drilling permit
on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report. If circumstances require operations to commence before the 3rd business day following
publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may be waived by the Director. Application for a waiver must be by sworn
affidavit providing the information necessary to evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f), and
any other information that would allow the Director to conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the drilling permit,
the applicant should retain the permit.

Permit Fee & Notification

Payment was received in the amount of $100 via credit card. It is requested that notification be given immediately upon the
spudding of the well. This information should be relayed to the Oil & Gas Division, Bismarck, via telephone. The following information
must be included: Well name, legal location, permit number, drilling contractor, company representative, date and time of spudding.
Office hours are 8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. Central Time. Our telephone number is (701) 328-8020, leave a
message if after hours or on the weekend.

NOTE: A Gamma Ray log must be run to ground surface and a CBL must be run on intermediate or longstring casing string if set.

NOTE: Intermediate or longstring casing string must be cemented above the top Dakota Group Sand.

Surveys are required at least every 30 feet in the build section and every 90 feet in the lateral section of a horizontal well. Measurement
inaccuracies are not considered when determining compliance with the spacing/drilling unit boundary setback requirement except in the
following scenarios: 1) When the angle between the well bore and the respective boundary is 10 degrees or less; or 2) If Industry standard
methods and equipment are not utilized. Consult the applicable field order for exceptions.

If measurement inaccuracies are required to be considered, a 2° MWD measurement inaccuracy will be applied to the horizontal portion of the well
bore. This measurement inaccuracy is applied to the well bore from KOP to TD.

REQUIRED ATTACHMENTS: Certified surveyor's plat, horizontal section plat, estimated geological tops, proposed mud/cementing plan,

directional plot/plan, $100 fee.

Re: Continental Resources standard CCL, CBL, 4-1/2” liner running and testing procedures

Continental Resources’ standard practice for running the cement bond log and casing
caliper log is to run both logs immediately after coming out of the hole after TD, prior to running
the 4-1/2” liner, to the deepest depth obtainable; however, if there are well control concerns that
require us to run the liner sooner, only the CBL will be run and the CCL will be run after setting
the liner.

Based on the CCL results, we determine the actual API minimum burst allowance for the 7”
casing. If the downgraded API burst pressure is below our minimum required frac pressures, we
will run a 4-1/2” frac string; if severe wear or holes are found in the casing, we will run a 5”
cemented, to surface, tie back string.

The CBL log is run in order to determine the top of cement, as required by the NDIC.
Our current 4-1/2” liner program for a 1280 unit is 30, evenly spaced, stages with 29 swellable
packers. The liner shoe is set approximately 180 feet off bottom. The shoe stage below the last
packer has 2 joints, a double valved float, one joint, and a ported guide shoe — appx 130 ft. The
liner is run using a running tool on the end of 4” DP. The 7” packer/hanger is set about 40 ft
above KOP between two casing collars but conditions occasionally occur that require setting
higher, either through unexpected failure or in order to isolate casing wear close to KOP.
Recently we have tried 40 stage liners and the trend to explore the optimum stage count will
continue.. Once the liner is at depth, a ball is dropped through the DP, the ball is pressured up
against the setting tool to approximately 2500 psi, and the 7” packer/hanger is set.

A push pull test is done to confirm the hanger has set. Then, a 4500 psi pressure test is
completed on the back side of the 4” DP to confirm the packer has set. The setting tool is then
backed off and the 4” DP/running tool is laid down.

Immediately after the rotary rig has been moved off the well location, the 7” csg and liner
packer/ hanger are tested to the frac pressure. The testers will rig up and test the tubing head to
5000 psi. Next a test plug will be run and set, using wire line, in the top of the 7” packer/hanger.
Testers will pressure up to our frac pressure, typically 8500 psi, to confirm the 7” is ready for
completion.

Subject: RE: Columbus Federal 3-16H and pad.

Thanks David. | got the email. Here is our schedule for the pad as of right now:

Columbus Federal 1-16H to spud on 3/24/2013 (may spud with the small rig around one week earlier if possible). We had planned on drilling the Columbus 1-
16H first and then come back in a year or so and drill the other 4 but if we get the permits for all and the order on the 1280 allows us to drill them all back to
back, we will most likely go ahead and drill them all at once. We will take a look at the 1280 order that covers the Columbus 1-16H and see if we can batch drill
them.

You should have everything on the 3-16H and the affidavit sometime Monday.
Thanks for the help,

Continental Resources, Inc, (CRI) respectfully submits the following information concerning the
prevention of a wellbore collision while drilling the Columbus Federal 3-16H, SENE of Sec. 16, T153N,
R101 W, Dunn County, North Dakota.

The Mildred 1, NDIC File No. 12306, is a plugged and abandoned, Red River formation, directional
well with a SHL of 1325° FSL, 660° FEL of Sec. 4, TI53N, R101W. The directional wellbore lies
approximately 660’ FEL of Sec. 4, T153N, R101W, terminating at a BHL 769° N. of SHL, 2094’ FSL
of Sec. 4, T153N, R101W. Bottom hole TVD of the existing directional well is 13451’. The deepest
casing string is 8-5/8” set at a depth of 3035° TVD.

The proposed Columbus Federal 3-16H is a horizontal well targeting the Middle Bakken formation.
Surface hole location for the Columbus Federal 3-16H is 2469’ FSL and 199° FEL of Sec. 16, T153N,
R1O1W. The majority of the Columbus Federal 3-16H lateral will lie 760° FEL in order to avoid the
existing Mildred 1 weilbore by approximately 100’. The lateral will taper back to 660° FEL, at 10155°
N. of SHL, after adequately clearing the segment of the Mildred 1 wellbore within this Baker-Bakken
pool.

The Baker-Bakken pool, as defined by NDIC Order No. 21551, is the interval from 50 feet above the top
of the Bakken Formation to above the top of the Birdbear Formation. CRI has assessed the geology of
the area and has determined this Bakken interval to be approximately 10461° TVD to 10,7717 TVD. On
the surface planar, the Mildred 1 wellbore exist in this interval for approximately 38°, from 1874’ FSL
to 1912’ FSL of Sec. 4, T153N, R94W.

The completion of the Columbus Federal 3-16H will protect the integrity of the Mildred 1 wellbore.
Stimulation plans will be made to include a buffer zone with swell packers of a minimum 500’ from
either side of the Mildred 1 wellbore existing within the Baker-Bakken pool. This zone will not be
perforated or completed,

CRI believes adequate precautions have been taken to prevent the possibility of a wellbore collision and
accepts all responsibility should such a collision occur.

Continental Resources, Inc. (CRI) respectfully submits the following information concerning the drilling
of the Columbus Federal 1-16H, 2-16H and 3-16H and the Tallahassee 2-16H and 3-16H, Sec. 16,
T153N, R101 W, Williams County, North Dakota.

CRI would like to propose the following safeguards and precautions to be taken while drilling the
Columbus Federal-Tallahassee wells to prevent any contamination to freshwater sources during the
drilling and completion of the wells:

1)

2)

3)

4)
5)

6)

7)

8)

During construction of the location, the entire location will be constructed per NDIC permit
stipulations, ensuring any spills or runoff which occur on location do not penetrate the fresh
ground water and are contained on the surface of the location. These modifications include, but
are not limited to, the inclusion of a liner being placed under the location, and cementing of the
rathole and mousehole.

Drainage will be re-routed to avoid the location, and erosion controls will be employed, as
appropriate, around the site to reduce erosion and the resulting sediment contamination to
freshwater runoff due to weather events.

The earthen berm, constructed to keep any freshwater runoff off the location, will also eliminate
any spills from leaving the location

No reserye pit or dry cuttings pit will be utilized on location.

The conductor will be drilled to a depth of 80°, and 20” pipe will be run to depth and cemented
to surface,

During drilling operations, a freshwater protection string of 13-3/8”" 48# H40 casing will be set to
a depth of 500’ and cemented to surface to protect the shallow freshwater zones, Standard 9-
5/8” 36# J-55 surface casing will be set 100° into the Pierre Shale, to a depth of 1940’, and
cemented to surface.

A frac string will be used to protect the intermediate casing during hydraulic fracturing of the
well.

CRI is submitting a comprehensive rig specific Spill Prevention Containment and
Countermeasure Plan to prepare for any event which may occur during drilling and completion
operations. A spill trailer will be located on location for spill response, if necessary.

CRI believes adequate planning and precautions are being taken to prevent any contamination to ground
water and surface waters.

the drilling operation are screened from the recycled drilling mud and directed to
a container were they are dried using fly ash or some other equally effective
absorbent material and are then transferred to the lined cuttings disposal pit
onsite. The fuel tank is tied into the fuel lines providing fuel flow to the
generators. Blowout preventers are placed over the drill hole casing and tested
prior to beginning the drilling.

112.7(a)(3)(ii) Discharge Prevention Measures including procedures for
routine handling of products (loading, unloading and facility transfers,
etc.); Before the drill rig moves on, the site is prepared for discharges
associated with tank ruptures, as the site is graded to contain all discharges and
storm runoff. When the rig is moved onto the site and set up additional discharge
prevention and containment measures are taken. Equipment inspection records

Page 2 of 6

are reviewed and the equipment is inspected following written procedures, the
written procedures are attached in the appendix of the plan. A dated record of the
inspection, signed by the appropriate supervisor or inspector is recorded and
filed with time sheets or safety meeting minutes, when the drill rig changes
locations and notes of deficiencies or acceptance are included. Operation and
maintenance of equipment is designed to prevent discharges. Personnel are
trained and made aware of the discharge prevention procedures and applicable
pollution control laws, rules and regulations. The tool pusher in charge of the drill
rig will have in his possession a copy of the Cyclone Drilling SPCC Plan and it is
his responsibility to instruct the employees and make them aware of the
discharge prevention measures contained in the plan. Scheduled briefings and
refreshers are to be conducted with all the employees prior to and during rig up
operations, such briefings are to be held during regularly scheduled safety
meetings.

Employees are assigned to make routine inspections of valves, hose connections
and other fluid connections for leaks. These inspections are made and
documented on a monthly basis at a minimum. These leaks are provided drip
pans and reported to the appropriate personnel for repair. If repairs cannot be
readily made then regular emptying of the drip pans is required until the repairs
can be made. Inspections of trenches and sumps are made on a regular basis to
insure that they are free flowing and functional. The containment berms are also
inspected periodically to insure their stability and function.

112.7(a)(3)(iii) Discharge or drainage controls such as secondary
containment around containers and other structures, equipment, and
procedures for the control of the discharge; Containment berms are placed
around the tanks containing crude oil, the invert drilling fluid, salt water tanks and
the empty tanks to be used for emergency storage, as secondary containment.
The containment berms are of adequate height to contain a rupture and total
failure of the largest tank contained within it amounting to 400 BBLS requiring a
containment capacity of 3,000 cu. ft. Similarly, berms are built around the crude
oil storage tanks on the site and requiring the same containment volume. Berms
or trenches and sumps are constructed around the drill rig itself, the drilling mud
tanks and diesel fuel tank, the sumps and trenches are sized to contain the
volume of the largest tank in the case of a rupture and complete failure.
Additionally, drip pans are placed under leaking valves, hose joints and other
sources of small leaks until the item can be replaced or repaired to not leak.
Regular inspections of these facilities are made to insure that they will function
per plan.

112.7(a)(3){iv) Countermeasures for discharge discovery, response, and
cleanup (both the facility’s capability and those that might be required of a
contractor); Regular inspections may reveal a discharge such as a leaking
valve or hose joint. These instances can readily be cleaned up by employees of
Cyclone Drilling using on site vacuums and containers. Larger spills up to and

Page 3 of 6

beyond the reporting limits can also be handled by Cyclone Drilling employees.
Spills that exceed the limitations of the onsite cleanup equipment or in the event
of a spill migrating offsite, will require the tool pushers’ notification of the
operator/owner of the site and they will contact the clean-up contractor thay have
contracted with to contain and clean-up such events.

112.7(a)(3)(v) Methods of disposal of recovered materials in accordance
with applicable legal requirements: When spills occur the fluids will be either
soaked up with absorptive material and placed in a container for transporting to
an approved disposal site or vacuumed up and placed in a storage container for
transportation to an approved disposal site. It is understood by all Cyclone
Drilling employees that there is not an approved disposal site on or around the
drilling rig to dispose of these recovered materials or fluids, other than drying
drilling cuttings and disposing of them in the cuttings pit.

112.7(a)(3)(vi) Contact list and phone numbers for the facility response
coordinator, National Response Center, cleanup contractors with whom
operator has an agreement for response, and all appropriate Federal, State,
and local agencies who must be contacted in the event of a discharge as
described in § 112.1(b). Facility Response Coordinator for Cyclone Drilling
HSE Dept. (Ph. 307-682-4161) is responsible for contacting the operators
environmental group so they can contact the appropriate Federal, State and
Local personnel in the event of a discharge as described in § 112.1(b).

112.7(a)(4) Information and procedures to enable a person reporting a
discharge as described in § 112.1(b) to relate information on the exact
address or location and phone number of the facility; the date and time of
the discharge, the type of material discharged; estimates of the total
quantity discharged; estimates of the quantity discharged as described in
§ 112.1(b); the source of the discharge: a description of all affected media;
the cause of the discharge; any damages or injuries caused by the
discharge; actions being used to stop, remove, and mitigate the effects of
the discharge; whether an evacuation may be needed; and, the names of
individuals and/or organizations who have also been contacted. In the
event of a discharge as described in §112.1(b) it is the responsibility of the tool
pusher to relate the above information to the operators environmental group so
they can contact, any emergency organizations and provide the reporting
necessary to the Federal, State and Local agencies that require reporting of such
a discharge. The tool pusher on the rig is the person in charge and either he or
the drilling superintendent have the responsibility of reporting the answers to the
above questions. These questions are spelled out on a “Discharge Reporting
Form” that each has at his disposal in the appendix of “Cyclone Drilling Oil Spill
Contingency Plan” In reporting a discharge a list of all individuals and or
organizations that received the report will be listed.

SPILL PREVENTION CONTAINMENT
AND COUNTERMEASURE PLAN (SPCC}

PER 40 CFR 112.7 DATED: SEPTEMBER 14, 2012

This plan will follow the guidelines and format of 40 CFR part 112.7 and will
replace the self-certified plan currently in affect.

112.7(a)(1) Discussion of facilities’ conformance with the requirements
listed in this part. The storage tanks on site store petroleum based drilling mud,
diesel fuel, the invert tanks being the base for the drilling mud, salt water tanks,
fresh water tanks, crude oil storage tanks and empty tanks for emergency
storage. In addition to the storage tanks, other operations that can produce
contaminants are the drilling operation itself and the cuttings drying operation. It
is the purpose of this plan to define the prevention containment and
countermeasure plan for discharges from any of these sources on the site. All
the actions taken in this regard are per approved policies of this part of 40 CFR
112. Universally and in setting up the drilling operation on the site prevention
measures are taken by grading the site to contain discharges, building in
effective valves and other related operational and control mechanisms to prevent
discharges. This equipment is installed and tested prior to beginning drilling
operations. The tanks and equipment are installed within secondary containment
berms and containment trenches and sumps are installed around the facilities
prior to beginning drilling operations with capacity to contain with freeboard a
rupture of the largest vessel associated with the containment. In the event of a
discharge the sites are equipped with vacuums that are capable of picking up the
spilled material and loading it into containers where it can be transferred to an
approved disposal location. In the event of a discharge larger than can be
handled by Cyclone and other manpower on location or that leaks offsite and
potentially into navigable waters of the US, the operator, under his directions will
arrange for trained contract personnel to immediately contain and clean-up the
discharge.

112.7(a)(2} This plan will comply with all applicable items of this part. With
no deviations anticipated.

112.7(a)(3) The attached sketch shows a typical layout of the drill rig sites
depicting the location, size and contents of the tanks. There are no
underground tanks nor are there any mobile or portable containers
associated with these drilling locations. The site is prepared in advance of
the drill rig coming onto the site. The sites are designed and constructed to
contain spills and tank ruptures on the site. The drill rig and associated tanks
and equipment are laid out in an efficient and effective manner to streamline the
drilling operation. Frack tanks are located in such a manner that they have easy
access to the mud tanks with valves located on both ends of transfer lines. The
drilling mud tanks are plumbed to the drill rig with valves appropriately located to

112.7({a)(5)(f} Personnel Training and Discharge Prevention Procedures:
The personnel working on the drilling crews are trained in the maintenance and
operation of all the equipment to prevent discharges, the discharge procedures
and general facility operations. They are also made aware of the contents of the
SPCC Plan. The tool pusher on each crew is the person on the location who is
accountable for discharge prevention and who reports to the Cyclone Drilling
Management. The tool pusher is responsible for conducting discharge
prevention briefings and assuring an adequate understanding of the Cyclone
Drilling SPCC Plan for the facility and any recent developments of new
precautionary measures due to failures or malfunctions are implemented.

112.7(a)(5)(g) Site Security: All persons entering the site are required to check
in with the tool pusher of the on duty crew. Unauthorized persons are not
allowed on the site. Unauthorized visitors are easily detected, questioned
regarding there presents and appropriately escorted to take care of their
business.

112.7(a)(5)(h) Facility Tank Truck Loading/Unloading: The tank truck
loading and unloading areas on the Cyclone Drilling Sites are located adjacent to
the frack tank or crude oil tank batteries the area adjacent to the tank battery,
where tank trucks are loaded and unloaded will be graded to drain into the
containment trenches and associated sump, surrounding the drill rig, mud tanks,
fuel tank, etc. Wheel chocks are used to prevent the truck from moving while
connected to the tanks during loading/unloading operations. Before departure
the vehicle is inspected for leaks in the lowermost drains and outlets and if they
are any detected the associated valves are tightened or adjusted to prevent
discharge while in transit. All above ground containers are checked and
evaluated for risk of discharge or failure and as necessary appropriate action
shall be taken.

Page 6 of 6

112.7(a)(5) Plan procedures to be used when a discharge occurs:

1) Immediately extinguish any heater or fire that may ignite the spill.

2) No smoking during spill control operations.

3) Close all associated valves.

4) Direct discharge to ditches or drains that will carry the discharge to a safe
holding sump or reserve pit.

5) Distribute hill, fibertex, gel, barite, or any other absorptive material available
as required to contain the discharge not entering the ditch, sump or reserve
pit.

6) Inspect area to ensure that all of the discharge is contained in ditches, sumps
or reserve pits. Add ditches or diversion structures as required to contain the
discharge onsite.

7) Start jet or sump pumps and transfer discharged material from sumps to
reserve pit or holding tanks.

8) After discharge is stopped, collect all used hulls, fibertex and similar
absorptive material for disposal per instruction from the drilling superintendent
or the tool pusher. No oil is to remain in the ditches or sumps that may create
a fire hazard.

9) Hoid collected discharged material for hauling and disposal in an approved
location.

10) If discharge migrates from the drill rig location Cyclone Drilling personnel will
use these same procedures stop and recover the discharge. Additionally the
tool pusher will notify the owners representative to notify the contract clean-
up company for clean-up and mitigation of the offsite discharge migration.

11) Fill out Site Discharge Reporting Form and distribute to appropriate agencies
and personnel. (Form included in Appendix of Plan)

112.7(a)(5)(b) Flow diagram of potential discharges from significant
sources as a result of facilities failure: Flow diagrams and quantities
included in appendix of the plan.

112.7(a)(5)(c) Site discharge containment system: The site discharge
containment system for the Cyclone Drilling Rigs is a combination of containment
berms, confinement trenches, sumps and reserve pits. Drip pans will be used for
small discharges until repairs are make or equipment replaced. (See typical site
plan included in appendix.)

112.7(a)(5)(d) Not applicable as all measures spelled out in this part are
practical as describe in each section.

112.7(a)(5)(e) Inspections, tests and records: Written procedures are
provided on the “Discharge Source Inspection Record”, these inspections are
recorded at least on a monthly basis or whenever a leak or discharge is detected
and reported, using the “Discharge Source Inspection Record” in the appendix.
These records are signed by the tool pusher onsite and maintained by Cyclone
Drilling for a period of 3 years.
