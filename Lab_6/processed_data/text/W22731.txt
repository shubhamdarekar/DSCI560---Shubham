DETAILS OF WORK

Slawson Exploration Company, Inc. is panning to begin reclamation work on the reserve pit of this well. The surface
owner is the State of North Dakota. Any oil in the pit will be skimmed off and used in Invert Mud for drilling other wells.
The water will be disposed of by Slawson at various licensed Slawson injection facilities, such as the Sanish 1-9SWD.
Once the fluids are removed the cuttings were dried and mixed with fly ash for stabilzation. The liner will then be folded
over the stabilized cuttings in the pit and buried approximately 6 ft. deep with back fill and topsoil. The site will then re-
seeded. This construction will be completed by one of the three following contractors pending availability.

1. Gold Star Production Services, LLC, 6219, 39th Street NW, Plaza, ND, 58771
2. FMR Services Inc., 3767 County Road 99W, Orland, CA, 95963

INTRODUCTION

The Slawson Exploration Co. Magnum 3-36-25H [SE SE Sec. 36, T153N, R101 W] is located
~15 miles southwest of the town of Williston in McKenzie County, North Dakota. The well was
the third of three wells drilled in Section 36. Magnum 3-36-25H was planned with one 10,386’
long northbound leg with intent to intersect regional fracture trends that might enhance reservoir
quality within the Middle Bakken Member.

Directional tools were utilized to build a curve and land within the 200’ legal setbacks of Section
36. Vertical deviation drilling was used to help ensure the wellbore crossed the eastern hard-line.
A single horizontal lateral in the Middle Bakken was proposed to be drilled into the NE 4 of NE
% of Section 25.

OFFSET INFORMATION

Three previously completed nearby wells were used as offset control on Magnum 3-36-25H. The
Lindvig 1-35 was drilled in August of 1981 by Texas Gas exploration Co 1.1 miles west of the
Magnum 3-36-25H. The Magnum 1-36-25H was the first of three laterals drilled in Section 36 by
Slawson Exploration Co and was spud in January of 2012. The third offset was the Slawson
Exploration Co.’s Magnum 2-36-25H, spud in March of 2012. The Magnum 2-36-25H was
drilled on the same pad and parallels the subject well to the east.

During the curve, gamma ray measurements were constantly compared to offset data to help
determine a proper landing depth. To aid in the landing of the curve, a table (Table 1) was
constructed utilizing isopach thicknesses to target of select gamma markers from the offset wells.
Due to variances of offset isopachs, a weighted average was used in forecasting a landing depth.
Comparing gamma ray markers at the Magnum 3-36-25H to correlative markers from the offsets
made it easier to predict the probable TVD depth of the Middle Bakken target. With its
proximity, the Magnum 2-36-25H most closely resembled gamma ray signatures at the Magnum
3-36-25H.

VERTICAL OPERATIONS

The Magnum 3-36-25H was spud on May 07, 2012 with the Nabors #419 drilling rig. A 13 %2”
hole was drilled with fresh water to 2,192’ MD and isolated with 9 5/8” 36# K-55 casing
cemented to surface. On May 12, 2012 vertical operations began. Upon casing exit the drilling
fluid was changed to diesel invert with a target weight of 9.4 to 9.7 ppg for use in the remaining
vertical and curve. The area surrounding Magnum 3-36-25H was a highly prosperous and well
developed Mission Canyon field. Magnum 3-36-25H was the first of the three wells drilled in
section 36 to avoid significant loss of drilling fluid upon reaching the Mission Canyon. Slides in
the vertical were put in place to cause the vertical to drift west away from the nearby Magnum 2-
36-25H.

The vertical was drilled to a KOP of 10,306’ MD with 2 HDBS bits. The first drilled from under
casing to 8,979’ MD where it was pulled as planned for the Kibbey bit trip. The second HDBS
bit was replaced at 10,300’ MD when the preliminary KOP was reached. An additional 6’ would
be drilled with the curve assembly before kicking off.

The first bit drilled 6,787’ in 48 hours for an average ROP of 141.39 ft/hr. The second bit
completed the vertical after drilling 1,321’ in 32.7 hours for an average ROP of 40.39 ft/hr.
Vertical operations were completed on May 16, 2012.

DIRECTIONAL OPERATIONS

Sperry Sun provided equipment and personnel for MWD and directional services. Sunburst
Consulting geologists worked closely throughout the project with Sperry Sun to make steering
decisions and maximize the amount of borehole in the pay zone. Attention was also paid to
providing a smooth lateral wellbore to ease the implementation of the aggressive production
fracture program. Tight adherence to the drill plan was required to prevent collision with
previously drilled laterals. As such, surveys were monitored closely to ensure a safe distance
from Magnum 2-36-25H.

Curve Build

The curve was to drill down 477’ TVD in 750’ MD and required 12 degrees of build per 100’
(Figures 2 & 3). The curve was drilled with a single 8 34” PDC bit. After completing the build
section 7’’ casing was set at 11,128’ MD, 10,809.74’ TVD, ~22’ below the Upper Bakken Shale.
The single HDBS bit drilled 843’ in 45.8 hours for an average drilling rate of 18.40 ft/hr.

The HDBS FXD55M combined with the Sperry directional motor drilled quickly while
providing predictable and generous build rates. The optimal performance of the curve assembly
allowed for increased rotation whilst decreasing time spent on the build section. The added
benefit of predictable build rates made forecasting the TVD of the False Bakken and Upper
Bakken Shale from penetration rates more reliable; this in turn allowed for on the fly adjustments
to landing target and insured a landing within the desired objective.

Lateral

Lateral drilling fluid was ~10.1— 9.7 ppg diesel invert. Three trips were required while drilling
the Magnum 3-36-25H lateral. The first came as penetration rates began to fall and sliding
became difficult at 16,798’ MD. A fresh motor and Security bit were put in place to continue the
lateral. Along with the BHA, a NOV agitator was picked up to ease the difficulty in sliding.
Drilling continued until 18,112’ MD when penetration rates dropped to zero as a result of a
failed motor. A new motor was put behind a fresh Security bit. Once back on bottom, the motor
drilled for 528’ before penetration rates again dropped to zero. A new slow speed BICO motor
was run with the same Security bit to finish out the lateral. The final BHA improved penetration
rates dramatically. The slow speed BICO proved to be the best performing motor of the lateral.

The first assembly drilled 5,655’ in 148.08 hours, much of that for a lateral turn, for an average
ROP of 38.18 ft/hr. The Second assembly drilled 1,314’ in 44.58 hours for an average speed of
29.47 ft/hr. The third assembly drilled 528’ in 18.34 hours for an average speed of 28.78 ft/hr.
The final assembly with the BICO motor drilled 2,535’ in 48.00 hours for and average of
52.81ft/hr. The well reached a total depth (TD) of 21,175’ MD at 02:45 CDT June 10, 2012.

GEOLOGIC EVALUATION AND HYDROCARBON SHOWS
Methods

Geologic supervision of Magnum 3-36-25H was provided by Sunburst Consulting, Inc. with two
wellsite geologists. A digital gas detector was interfaced with a Pason electronic data recorder
system. Pason provided drill rate, on-off bottom, and pump strokes to the gas detection computer
and received total gas information from Sunburst for viewing around location. Rig crews caught
lagged samples under the direction of Sunburst geologists (see LITHOLOGY for sample lag
intervals and descriptions). Sample cuttings were examined wet and dry under a binocular
microscope using both plain (broad spectrum) and transmitted light. Sunburst personnel also
closely examined MWD gamma ray information and penetration rates to aid in steering decisions
and dip rate estimations.

Lithology and Hydrocarbon Shows

Geologic evaluation began at 8,400’ MD in the Anhydrite and Limestone of the Kibbey
Formation [Mississippian, Big Snowy Group]. Samples from this area were described as:

ARGILLACEOUS LIMESTONE: light gray to gray, mudstone to wackestone, microcrystalline, firm, earthy
texture, no visible porosity;
SILTSTONE: orange, friable, sub blocky to sub platey, calcareous cement, moderately cemented, no visible

porosity;
ANHYDRITE: off white, cryptocrystalline, soft, massive, amorphous texture, no visible porosity.

The Charles Formation [Mississippian, Madison Group] was penetrated at 8,592’ TVD
(-6,425’). The Base of the Last Charles Salt was drilled at 9,265’ TVD (-7,087’), 6’ high to
Magnum 2-36-25H. Samples from this interval (Figure 4) were described as:

SALT: translucent, crystalline, hard, anhedral to trace subhedral, crystalline texture, no visible
porosity; trace ANHYDRITE: off white, cryptocrystalline, soft, amorphous texture, no visible
porosity;

LIMESTONE: light gray to gray, mudstone to wackestone, microcrystalline, firm, earthy texture,
no visible porosity.

Figure 4: Photograph of salt, anhydrite, and limestone found in Charles Formation.

The Mission Canyon [Mississippian, Madison Group] was penetrated at 9,480’ TVD (-7,302’),
13’ high to Magnum 2-36-25H. Surrounding the Magnum 3-36-25H was a heavily produced
Mission Canyon field. Large amounts of LCM prevented losses of drilling fluid, but made it
difficult to evaluate overall Mission Canyon potential. Due to heavy sample contamination,
pictures of cuttings from the Mission Canyon are not available. Samples from the Mission
Canyon were described as:

LIMESTONE: mudstone, light brown gray, light brown, trace medium brown, microcrystalline, firm to
friable, earthy to slightly crystalline texture, trace disseminated pyrite, trace pinpoint porosity, rare spotty
light to medium brown oil stain;

DOLOMITE: mudstone, light gray brown, friable, earthy texture, trace pinpoint porosity very trace light
brown oil stain;

LIMESTONE: mudstone, dark gray, common off white to cream, microcrystalline, firm, dense, earthy to
trace crystalline texture, rare dark brown spotty oil stain;

DOLOMITIC LIMESTONE: mudstone, off white to cream, tan to light brown, light gray brown, very fine
grained, firm to hard, crystalline texture, trace alga laminated, slightly argillaceous, trace light brown oil
stain, no visible porosity.

The Lodgepole Formation [Mississippian, Madison Group] top was drilled at 10,0177 TVD
(-7,839’), 5’ high to Magnum 2-36-25H. Approximately 745’ TVD of limestone, much of it
argillaceous mudstone with common pyrite and sparry calcite, was drilled in the Lodgepole.
Samples collected from the Lodgepole (Figure 5) were described as:

ARGILLACEOUS LIMESTONE: mudstone, medium gray to rare off white to rare medium brown,
microcrystalline, firm to common hard, dense, earthy to rare crystalline texture, no visible
porosity;

LIMESTONE: cream to white, gray, light gray, light brown, very fine crystalline, friable,
microsucrosic texture, argillaceous in part, possible intercrystalline porosity, no visible oil stain.

Lodgepole Formation (note live oil stain).

The ‘False Bakken’ was penetrated at 10,762’ TVD (-8,584’), evidence of a 10,804’ TVD
target depth. The underlying Scallion interval showed gas peaks as high as 1,947 units.

The Upper Shale of the Bakken Formation [Mississippian — Devonian] was drilled at 10,772’
TVD (-8,594’), supporting a casing point of 10,805’ TVD. The Bakken came in 2’ low to the
Magnum 2-36-25H. Sample returns were typical black, carbonaceous, and petroliferous shale
(Figure 6), characterized by gamma ray values in excess of 400 API. Total gas readings
displayed peaks up to 477 units with background measurements ranging between 250 and 350
units. Samples were described as:

SHALE: black, firm to friable, sub blocky to sub platy, earthy texture, petroliferous, carbonaceous,
abundant disseminated pyrite, nodular pyrite, no visible porosity.

Bakken Shale.

The Middle Member of the Bakken Formation was penetrated at 10,970’ MD, (10,787 TVD),
2’ low to the Magnum 2-36-25H, evidence supporting a target of 10,805’ TVD (Table 1). While
drilling the Magnum 3-36-25H, samples varied only slightly within the target area. Some
differences in oil staining could be seen. The targeted interval consisted of a series of high
gamma (110-120 API) and cool gamma (85-95 API) intervals stacked upon one another.
Commonly in the high gamma markers samples would consist of silty sandstone mixed with
light gray siltstone stringers. The facies of cool gamma were primarily well cemented sandstone
with marker F2 showing occasional stringers of lime packstone. Samples collected from the
Middle Bakken (Figure 7& 8) were described as:

SILTSTONE: medium brown, friable to trace firm, sub blocky to sub platy, calcareous cement, poorly to
trace moderately cemented, trace disseminated pyrite, no visible porosity.

SILTY SANDSTONE: cream to off white, very fine grained, friable to trace firm, sub angular to sub
rounded, well sorted, calcareous cement, poorly to trace moderately cemented, trace disseminated pyrite,
possible intergranular porosity, trace dark brown spotty oil stain .

Figure 7: Photograph of siltstone found above and below zone (L). Figure 8: Photograph of silty sandstone found
throughout target zone (R).

The lateral began with a background gas of about 150 units with an average connection gas
above 200 units (Note: See Figure 9 for visual representation of this section). Gas levels
decreased slightly by 11,400 MD with average background measurements around 100 units and
peaks reaching only 150 units. With lower gas levels in the middle of the target zone, the bit was
allowed to climb up to about 2’-3’ from the top of zone. As the bit approached the top of zone,
gas levels rose slightly to 150 units with connections averaging around 250 units. By 12,200
MD?’ the wellbore had reached its pinnacle and began to descend in formation. As the bit traveled
back down through zone, gas levels remained steady. The wellbore would then flatten low in
zone within the F4 marker. This low in zone position was accompanied with waning
hydrocarbon gas. By 13,000’ MD the average background gas was less then 150 units. Despite
relatively low backgrounds connections averaged above 500 units. Average gas measurements
climbed slightly around 13,900’ MD when the bit entered the middle portion of zone passing
through marker F2. Background gas levels doubled to an average of 250-300 units with
connections averaging above 600 units. Gas levels remained fairly steady until ~15,200’ MD
where they rose to their highest levels thus far (Figure 10). Background gas levels between
15,200’ and 15,700’ MD would average around 400 units with connections nearing 700 units.
Additionally within this interval, increases in spotty black oil stain as well as the more common
dark brown oil stain was seen in cuttings. The total gas increase was localized and measurements
decreased to a lateral low by 16,000’ MD despite maintaining an approximate stratigraphic
position.

Decreasing background gas levels were less than half of previous measurements, around 150
units with connections barely averaging over 250 units. The decrease in gas did coincide with a
very slight decrease in oil staining and a more common hardening of calcite cement. It is
possible that the increased cementing caused porosity occlusion. Relatively low gas levels would
continue until roughly 16,900’ MD when they began to rise despite being low within the target
interval. The average background gas would hover around 350-400 units, but connections
lowered slightly to 400-500 units. Gas levels were higher here then any previous trips to bottom
of our targeted interval.

Gas levels would remain steady over the next 1,000’ before decreasing slightly. By 18,300’ MD,
average background gas was less then 300 units and connections were barely distinguishable. At
this point in the lateral the bit had just reentered the bottom of the targeted interval. As the
wellbore climbed in section gas levels would increase. Beginning at 18,700’ MD, gas levels
climbed briefly, approaching 600 units, before declining and leveling off around 18,850 MD.
Hydrocarbon gas levels remained steady with backgrounds averaging of 250-300 units and
occasionally as high as 400 units. While the wellbore approached TD, the bit began climbing
aggressively. It soon passed to its highest point within zone and background levels increased to a
lateral high. The average background would reach 500+ units with connections over 800 units.

During the lateral there were three trips to surface for BHA changes. The change-outs allowed
for the recording of trip gases of 1,017, 3,081, and 1,388 units. The second was punctuated by a
10’-15’ flare.

Marker F1: This marker made up the first 2’ of the zone (Note: See Figure 11 for visual
representation of this section). Overlying Marker F1 was a dark siltstone with trace spotty brown
oil stain and low porosity. Increases in pyrite and gray sandstone were also observed. Decreased
oil staining and intergranular porosity was common in this marker.

Marker F2: Marker F2 began about 3’ into the target zone and continued until 5’ into zone. This
facies was encountered early in the tangent section before setting casing. It was similar in nearly
every way to Marker F4. Common characteristics of this marker were increasing white to cream
sandstone and increasing pyrite levels. On occasion this marker would contain trace amounts of
lime packstone. It is important to note that exceptional porosity was observed in offset electric
logs within this interval, showing porosity up to 13%. It is unclear how permeable this interval
is, but with production fracturing the increased porosity will likely benefit overall production.
Typically within this marker, rare to occasional spotty brown oil staining was seen with areas of
spotty black oil stain. This marker shared gamma characteristics with F4 and F6, averaging 85-
95 API.

Marker F3: Marker F3 extended from 4’-6’ into the target. This marker appeared slightly
warmer then surrounding markers reaching 105-110 API. Samples were identical to that of
Marker Fl. Trace to rare light brown oil staining was typical, but occasionally increased to
include spotty light black staining. Some hydrocarbon staining may have been obscured by the
darker colors of the sandstone in this marker. Hydrocarbon gas levels were generally higher in
the warm gamma intervals found at Markers F3 and F5. This may be due to the tight nature of
the cream and off white sandstones found in the low gamma intervals.

Conclusions

The Magnum 3-36-25H shows moderate potential for hydrocarbon production. The intervals
marked as F1, F2, and F3 are recorded to have as much as 13% porosity on offsets. The Slawson
fracture program will likely maximize the local porosity matrix and allow for increased
production value. Gas levels were lower at the Magnum 3-36-25H than recorded at the previous
Magnum laterals, but initial production numbers from Magnum _ 1-36-25H provide
encouragement. The wellbore remained with in the targeted interval for over 90% of the lateral
total footage which will help to maximize frac potential.

SUMMARY

1) The Magnum 3-36-25H was spud on May 07, 2012 with the Nabors #419 drilling rig.
Vertical operations were completed on May 15, 2012.

2) Localized depletion of the Mission Canyon made vertical operations difficult; however,
quick and effective use of LCM helped to prevent the loss of drilling fluid that was seen
on the Magnum 1-36-25H and Magnum 2-36-25H.

3) A single HDBS bit drilled a 843’ curve in 45.80 hours for an average drilling rate of
18.41 ft/hr. Four BHA’s were required to complete the 10,047’ long lateral

4) Lateral hole drag was reduced with the use of an inline reamer. The ease at which the bit
was able to reach bottom while sliding should indicate a nicely groomed wellbore for
liner insertion.

5) Magnum 3-36-25H reached TD at 02:45 CDT on June 10, 2012. The wellbore remained
within the targeted interval for 91% of the total lateral footage.

6) The Slawson Exploration Co. Magnum 3-36-25H awaits completion operations to
determine its ultimate production potential. 4” production liner will be set to bottom to
facilitate an aggressive fracture stimulation program.

Marker F4: The F4 marker began about 6’ from the top of zone and in the lateral averaged a 95-
105 API gamma signature. The lower cool gamma marker did not show staining that would set it
apart for other areas within zone. Cream to off white sandstone made up the majority of samples
examined in this marker. The sandstone was identical to marker F2 though packstone was never
observed within this interval.

Marker FS: Marker F5 ranged from 9’-12’ below the top of zone. This marker made up the last
3’ of zone, comprised of sand and siltstones much like Marker Fl. Proceeding downward
through section in this marker, gamma measurements increased above 120 API, indicating an
exit from the bottom of zone. Sands within this interval showed trace dark brown oil stain. The
siltstones show virtually no oil staining and were tight in nature with grayish brown coloration.

from the near-by Fossum well.

Geo-Steering

The target zone within the Middle Bakken is defined as the 14’ zone below gamma marker
“MBKMGR” (Marker Fl; Figure 11). The target zone in the Middle Bakken was established
based on the samples and electric logs from nearby offset wells. Prognosis predicted 35’ of
viable zone between the Bakken shales, the first 13’ of which is above the desired target. The
Magnum 3-36-25H required turning the lateral from northwest to due north shortly after exiting
intermediate casing which resulted in the implementation of slides purely for azimuth. The initial
prognosis called for a regional dip of a nearly flat 0.09° down which predicted the pay zone to
drop ~16’ over the course of the two section lateral. Gamma markers from a large collection of
offset data showed little to no definition within the targeted interval. As the lateral progressed,
the low gamma valleys of makers F2, F4, and F6 became the most recognizable.

The bit exited the Upper Bakken Shale at 10,970’ MD (10,787? TVD) and passed into the top of
the target interval at 11,017’ MD (Note: See Figure for visual representation of this section). The
wellbore landed at a casing point of 11,128’ MD (10,810’ TVD), approximately 23’ into the

Middle Bakken and 10’ below the “MBKMGR” marker (Marker Fl). The wellbore continued
through zone until contact with Marker F4 was seen at 11,851’ MD. Stratigraphically, that put
the bit 5’ from the bottom of zone. The bit was pushed up to gain separation from the bottom of
zone. The top of target was estimated to have dropped approximately 2’ for dip of 0.14° up.
While turning due north, the bit was also pushed up through zone. At 12,504’ MD, Marker F4
was seen again with a 4’ change in TVD, evidence of a dip change to ~0.36° up.

The bit continued within zone when gamma suggested the bit had contacted Marker F2 at
13,229’ MD. Contact with this marker suggested the bit was roughly 4’ below the top of target
and dip flattened. The bit would rise and fall through target until making contact with Marker F2
at 13,604’ MD. This showed that dip had increased dramatically to 0.40° up. As the lateral
progressed repeated contact with Marker F4 at 14,741’ and 15,502’ MD showed dip decreasing
to 0.07° and flat, respectively. The lateral remained within the targeted interval until 17,465’
MD, when the wellbore exited the bottom of the target and slides had to be executed to redirect
drilling back into zone. Local dip rates as high as 0.25° up made returning to zone difficult. After
~900’ the bit reentered zone. Contact with Marker F4 at 19,530’ MD would turn drilling back
down as dip flatten to 0.06° up. As the lateral came to a close, gamma was evidence of dip
steepening slightly to 0.08° up. As the wellbore approached TD, the bit began to build
aggressively on rotation and nearly reach the top of zone. The final data point showed that
formation had flattened.

The well ended with the bit about 16’ below the Upper Bakken Shale at 21,175’ MD. The final
bottom hole location of Magnum 3-36-25H is 10,031.43’ North and 1,374.86’ west of surface
location or approximately 265.17’ FNL and 1,639.86’ FEL, NW NE Sec. 25 T153N, R101W.

LITHOLOGY

Rig crews caught samples in 30’ intervals from 8,400’ — 11,150’ MD and 50’ samples from 11,150’—
21,128’ MD (TD). Gamma ray marker tops have been inserted into the sample descriptions below for
reference. Samples were examined wet and dry under a binocular microscope. Sample descriptions begin
just above the Kibbey Lime. The drilling fluid was diesel invert mud from surface casing exit (2,192 MD)
to 21,175’ MD (TD).

SESE Section 36-153N-101W
McKenzie County
Well File # 22731

Dear Khem :

Pursuant to Commission Order No. 18012, approval to drill the above captioned well is hereby given. The
approval is granted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than
the 200' setback from the north & south boundaries and 500' setback from the east & west boundaries within
the 1280 acre spacing unit consisting of All of Sections 36 & 25 T153N R101W.

PERMIT STIPULATIONS: SLAWSON EXPLORATION must contact NDIC Field Inspector Marc
Binns at 701-220-5989 prior to location construction. A PERIMETER DIKE IS REQUIRED DUE TO
THE ADJACENT DRAINAGE AT THE NDIC INSPECTOR'S DISCRETION.

Drilling pit

NDAC 43-02-03-19.4 states that “a pit may be utilized to bury drill cuttings and solids generated during well
drilling and completion operations, providing the pit can be constructed, used and reclaimed in a manner that will
prevent pollution of the land surface and freshwaters. Reserve and circulation of mud system through earthen pits
are prohibited. All pits shall be inspected by an authorized representative of the director prior to lining and use.
Drill cuttings and solids must be stabilized in a manner approved by the director prior to placement in a cuttings

pit.”

Form 1 Changes & Hard Lines

Any changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC.
The proposed directional plan is at a legal location. The minimum legal coordinate from the well head at casing
point is: 235W. Also, based on the azimuth of the proposed lateral the maximum legal coordinate from the well
head is: 1O096N & 235W.

Location Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period)

Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the
approved drilling permit on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report. If circumstances require operations to
commence before the 3rd business day following publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may
be waived by the Director. Application for a waiver must be by sworn affidavit providing the information
necessary to evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f), and any other
information that would allow the Director to conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the
drilling permit, the applicant should retain the permit.

Permit Fee & Notification

Payment was received in the amount of $100 via credit card. It is requested that notification be given
immediately upon the spudding of the well. This information should be relayed to the Oil & Gas Division,
Bismarck, via telephone. The following information must be included: Well name, legal location, permit number,
drilling contractor, company representative, date and time of spudding. Office hours are 8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m.
and 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. Central Time. Our telephone number is (701) 328-8020, leave a message if after hours
ot on the weekend.

Survey Requirements for Horizontal, Horizontal Re-entry, and Directional Wells

NDAC Section 43-02-03-25 (Deviation Tests and Directional Surveys) states in part (that) the survey
contractor shall file a certified copy of all surveys with the director free of charge within thirty days of completion.
Surveys must be submitted as one electronic copy, or in a form approved by the director. However, the director
may require the directional survey to be filed immediately after completion if the survey is needed to conduct the
operation of the director's office in a timely manner. Certified surveys must be submitted via email in one adobe
document, with a certification cover page to certsurvey@nd.gov.
Survey points shall be of such frequency to accurately determine the entire location of the well bore.
Specifically, the Horizontal and Directional well survey frequency is 100 feet in the vertical, 30 feet in the curve
(or when sliding) and 90 feet in the lateral.

Confidential status

Your request for confidential status of all information furnished to the Director, or his representatives, is
hereby granted. Such information, except production runs, shall remain confidential for six months commencing
on the date the well is spud.

Confidential status notwithstanding, the Director and his representatives shall have access to all well
records wherever located. Your company personnel, or any person performing work for your company shall
permit the Director and his representatives to come upon any lease, property, well, or drilling rig operated or
controlled by them, complying with all safety rules, and to inspect the records and operation of such wells and to
have access at all times to any and all records of wells. The Commission's field personnel periodically inspect
producing and drilling wells. Any information regarding such wells shall be made available to them at any time
upon request. The information so obtained by the field personnel shall be maintained in strict confidence and
shall be available only to the Commission and its staff.

Surface casing cement

Tail cement utilized on surface casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi within 12
hours, and tail cement utilized on production casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi
before drilling the plug or initiating tests.

Logs

NDAC Section 43-02-03-31 requires the running of a Cement Bond Log from which the presence of
cement can be determined in every well in which production or intermediate casing has been set and a Gamma
Ray Log must be run from total depth to ground level elevation of the well bore. All logs must be submitted as
one paper copy and one digital copy in LAS (Log ASCII) format, or a format approved by the Director. Image
logs that include, but are not limited to, Mud Logs, Cement Bond Logs, and Cyberlook Logs, cannot be produced
in their entirety as LAS (Log ASCI)) files. To create a solution and establish a standard format for industry to
follow when submitting image logs, the Director has given approval for the operator to submit an image log as a
TIFF (*.tif) formatted file. The TIFF (*.tif) format will be accepted only when the log cannot be produced in its
entirety as a LAS (Log ASCII) file format. The digital copy may be submitted on a standard CD, or attached to an
email sent to digitallogs@nd.gov Thank you for your cooperation.

Sincerely,
