WELL EVALUATION

Figure 1. Nabors Drilling rig B22 at the Oasis Petroleum Kline Federal 5300 31-18 8B
During April, 2015 in McKenzie County, North Dakota.

INTRODUCTION

The Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC Kline Federal 5300 31-18 8B [Lot 3 Section 18,
T153N, R1OOW] is located in Baker Field of the Williston Basin in western North Dakota. This
section lies approximately 7 miles south of the town of Williston and adjacent to Lake
Sakakawea in McKenzie County. The Kline Federal 5300 31-18 8B is a horizontal Middle
Bakken well, in a double-section, laydown spacing unit permitted to drill to the east from the
surface location within Section 18, continuing through Section 17 to the proposed bottom-hole
location (PBHL) in that section. There are 500’ setbacks along the north and south borders and
200’ setbacks from the east and west borders within the 1,280 acre spacing unit. The well
consists of one Middle Bakken lateral. The vertical hole was planned to be drilled to
approximately 10,221’. The curve would be built at 12 degrees per 100’ to land within the
Middle Bakken. Directional drilling technologies and geosteering techniques were used to land
in the Middle Bakken reservoir and maintain exposure to the ideal target rock. Oasis Petroleum
is targeting a silty sandstone facies of the Middle Bakken with intent to intersect porosity and
fracture trends enhancing reservoir quality.


OFFSET WELLS

Offset well data used for depth correlation during curve operations are found in the ‘Control
Data’ section appended to this report. Offset well control was essential in providing control data,
making it possible to develop a prognosis of formation tops and landing target depth. By
referencing the gamma signature of these offsets, a model was formed for the target interval
pinpointing a strategic landing. Formation thicknesses expressed by gamma ray signatures in
these wells were compared to gamma data collected during drilling operations in order to
successfully land the curve. The target landing true vertical depth (TVD) was periodically
updated during drilling to ensure accurate landing of the curve.

GEOLOGY

The Mission Canyon Formation [Mississippian Madison Group] was logged 9,393' MD 9,392'
TVD (-7,359' SS). The Mission Canyon Formation consisted of a lime mudstone that was
described as light gray, light brown to brown, gray brown, trace dark gray in color. The lime
mudstone was predominately friable to firm, with an earthy to rare crystalline texture. Some
intervals contained a trace of black-brown algal material, traces of fossil fragments, and traces of
disseminated pyrite. Also present was an argillaceous lime mudstone that was described as light
gray, occasional medium gray, rare gray tan, rare off white, trace dark gray in color. The
argillaceous lime mudstone was predominately firm to friable, crystalline to chalky texture.
Some intervals contained a trace of disseminated pyrite. Gas shows were not present. Rare
intercrystalline porosity was noted as well as trace spotty light brown oil stain while logging the
Mission Canyon Formation.

The Upper Bakken Shale [Mississippian-Bakken Formation] was drilled at 10,835' MD 10,671'
TVD (-8,638' SS). Entry into this member was characterized by high gamma, elevated
background gas and increased rates of penetration. The black to black gray carbonaceous and
petroliferous shale was hard with a sub blocky to sub platy texture. Fracture porosity was noted,
and trace minerals were observed including disseminated pyrite and calcite fracture fill.
Hydrocarbons evaluated in this interval reached a maximum of 775 units of drilling gas.

The Middle Bakken [Mississippian-Devonian Bakken Formation] was reached at 10,883' MD
10,687' TVD (-8,654' SS) which was 0’ low to the Oasis Petroleum NA LLC Kline Federal 5300
31-18 15T. The target zone of the Middle Bakken was to be drilled in a predominately 16 foot
zone beginning 12 feet below the Upper Bakken Shale.

Samples in the Middle Bakken were predominantly silty sandstone which was described as light-
medium brown, occasional light gray brown, rare light gray in color. It was very fine grained,
firm-friable, sub rounded to sub angular, smooth, moderately sorted, calcite cement moderately
cemented. A trace of disseminated and nodular pyrite was noted as was occasional intergranular
porosity. Also noted was common light to medium brown spotty to even oil stain.

Figure 2 & 3. Middle Bakken silty sandstone dry (left) and wet (right) samples from the target zone.

Hydrocarbon Shows

Gas monitoring and fluid gains provided evidence of a hydrocarbon saturated reservoir during
the drilling of the Kline Federal 5300 31-18 8B. Oil and gas shows at the shakers and in samples
were continuously monitored. In the closed mud system, hydrostatic conditions were maintained
near balance, this allowed for gas and fluid gains from the well to be evaluated. Gas varied
according to stratigraphic position and penetration rates which may have reflected increased
porosity. During the vertical, gas peaks of 20 to 31 units were noted, against a 9.4-10.2 lb/gal
diesel-invert mud weight. Background concentrations in the lateral ranged from 1,000 to 6,000
units, against a 9.7-10.4 lb/gal saltwater gel drilling fluid. Connection peaks 5,000 to 7,139 units
were observed, as were drilling gas shows of 500 units to 6,823 units coinciding with the best
shows. Chromatography of gas revealed typical concentrations of methane, ethane and propane
characteristic of Middle Bakken Member gas.

Geosteering

Ryan Energy Technologies provided personnel and equipment for measurement-while-drilling
(MWD) services. The RPM directional drillers, MWD, and Sunburst Consulting personnel
worked closely together throughout the project to evaluate data and make steering decisions to
maximize the amount of borehole in the targeted zones and increase rate of penetration (ROP) of
the formation.

The 1,029’ curve was drilled in 26 hours. It was drilled with a bottom hole assembly (BHA)
consisting of bit #3, a Security MMD55M PDC bit, attached to a 2.38 degree fixed NOV stage
7/8 5.0 motor and MWD tools. The curve was successfully landed at 11,058’ MD and 10,702’
TVD, approximately 15’ into the Middle Bakken. Seven inch diameter 32# HCP-110
intermediate casing was set to 11,042’ MD.

Geologic structure maps of the Kline Federal 5300 31-18 8B and surrounding control wells had
estimated gross formation dip to be down at approximately -0.2° to the TD of the lateral. The
preferred drilling interval consisted of a 16 foot zone located approximately 12 feet into the
Middle Bakken. Penetration rates, gas shows, gamma ray data, and sample observations were
utilized to keep the wellbore in the preferred stratigraphic position in the target zone. Using
offset well data provided by Oasis representatives, projected porosity zones were identified in the
preferred drilling areas.

placement in formation. The slightly lower gamma (between B & C) was observed as the well-
bore moved to the top of the target zone, followed by lower gamma as the well-bore moved
higher, out of the target zone. As the well-bore moved lower in formation, the lower gamma
(below D) was seen when at the bottom of the target zone. Samples collected when drilling low
in the target zone tended to have a greater concentration of the light gray to gray silty sandstone
than did the samples collected when the well-bore was higher in the target zone. This lateral was
drilled in a little over 5 days from casing exit to TD, with one necessitated trip at 15,933’ for a
mud motor failure at which time the bit was replaced. Well site teams worked closely together
with directional to maximize penetration rates averaging 200 to 280 feet per hour while rotating,
resulting in 3 days of over 2,000’ of lateral progress. The well site team was able to keep the well
bore in the desired target the entire well. The TD of 20,395’ MD was achieved at 10:00 hours
CDT April 30, 2015. The wellbore was completed with 100% of the lateral in target, opening
9,353’ (measurement taken from uncased lateral portion) of potentially productive reservoir
rock. The hole was then circulated and reamed for completion.

SUMMARY

The Kline Federal 5300 31-18 8B is a successful well in Oasis Petroleum’s horizontal Middle
Bakken development program in Baker Field. The project was drilled from surface casing to TD
in 13.25 days. The TD of 20,395’ MD was achieved at 10:00 hours CDT May 1, 2015. The well
site team worked together to maintain the well bore in the desired target interval for 100% of the
lateral, opening 9,353’ of potentially productive reservoir rock.

Samples in the Middle Bakken were predominantly silty sandstone which was described as light-
medium brown, occasional light gray brown, rare light gray in color. It was very fine grained,
firm-friable, sub rounded to sub angular, smooth, moderately sorted, calcite cement moderately
cemented. A trace of disseminated and nodular pyrite was noted as was occasional intergranular
porosity. Also noted was common light to medium brown spotty to even oil stain.

Hydrocarbon shows on the Kline Federal 5300 31-18 8B varied according to stratigraphic
position and penetration rates which may have reflected increased porosity. The overall gas and
hydrocarbon shows were encouraging and indicate a hydrocarbon-rich system in the Middle
Bakken.

The Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC. Kline Federal 5300 31-18 8B awaits completion
operations to determine its ultimate production potential.

LITHOLOGY

Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC
Kline Federal 5300 31-18 8B

Rig crews caught 30’ sample intervals, under the supervision of Sunburst geologists, from 8,240’, to the TD of the lateral at
20,395’. Formation tops and lithologic markers have been inserted into the sample descriptions below for reference. Sample
descriptions begin in the Kibbey Formation just prior to the Kibbey Lime. Samples were examined wet and dry under a
binocular microscope. Sample fluorescent cuts are masked by invert mud through intermediate casing. Quantifiers in order
of increasing abundance are trace, rare, occasional, common and abundant.

LOT3 Section 18-153N-100W
McKenzie County
Well File # 28754
Dear Lauti:

Pursuant to Commission Order No. 23752, approval to drill the above captioned well is hereby given. The
approval is granted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than
the 500' setback from the north & south boundaries and 200' setback from the east & west boundaries within the
1280 acre spacing unit consisting of Sections 17 & 18 T153N R100W.

PERMIT STIPULATIONS: Effective June 1, 2014, a covered leak-proof container (with placard) for
filter sock disposal must be maintained on the well site beginning when the well is spud, and must
remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations are
conducted. Due to the proximity of Lake Sakakawea to the well site, a dike is required surrounding the
entire location. OASIS PETRO NO AMER must contact NDIC Field Inspector Richard Dunn at 701-
770-3554 prior to location construction.

Drilling pit

NDAC 43-02-03-19.4 states that “a pit may be utilized to bury drill cuttings and solids generated during well
drilling and completion operations, providing the pit can be constructed, used and reclaimed in a manner that will
prevent pollution of the land surface and freshwaters. Reserve and circulation of mud system through earthen pits
are prohibited. All pits shall be inspected by an authorized representative of the director prior to lining and use.
Drill cuttings and solids must be stabilized in a manner approved by the director prior to placement in a cuttings

pit.”

Form 1 Changes & Hard Lines

Any changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC.
The proposed directional plan is at a legal location. Based on the azimuth of the proposed lateral the maximum
legal coordinate from the well head is: 10051’ east.

Location Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period)

Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the
approved drilling permit on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report. If circumstances require operations to
commence before the 3rd business day following publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may
be waived by the Director. Application for a waiver must be by sworn affidavit providing the information
necessary to evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f, and any other

DETAILS OF WORK

Oasis requests permission for suspension of drilling for up to 90 days for the referenced well under NDAC
43-02-03-55. Oasis intends to drill the surface hole with freshwater based drilling mud and set surface casing with a
small drilling rig and move off within 3 to 5 days. The casing will be set at a depth pre-approved by the NDIC per the
Application for Permit to Drill NDAC 43-02-03-21. No saltwater will be used in the drilling and cementing operations
of the surface casing. Once the surface casing is cemented, a plug or mechanical seal will be placed at the top of the
casing to prevent any foreign matter from getting into the well. A rig capable of drilling to TD will move onto the
location within the 90 days previously outlined to complete the drilling and casing plan as per the APD. The
undersigned states that this request for suspension of drilling operations in accordance with the Subsection 4 of
Section 43-02-03-55 of the NDAC, is being requested to take advantage of the cost savings and time savings of using
an initial rig that is smaller than the rig necessary to drill a well to total depth but is not intended to alter or extend
the terms and conditions of, or suspend any obligation under, any oil and gas lease with acreage in or under the
spacing or drilling unit for the above-referenced well. Oasis understands NDAC 43-02-03-31 requirements regarding
confidentiality pertaining to this permit. The lined reserve pit will be fenced immediately after construction if the well
pad is located in a pasture (NDAC 43-02-03-19 & 19.1). Oasis will plug and abandon the well and reclaim the well site
if the well is not drilled by the larger rotary rig within 90 days after spudding the well with the smaller drilling rig.
Notify NDIC inspector Richard Dunn at 701-770-3554 with spud and TD info.

RE: Filter Socks and Other Filter Media
Leakproof Container Required
Oil and Gas Wells

Dear Operator,

North Dakota Administrative Code Section 43-02-03-19.2 states in part that all waste material associated with
exploration or production of oil and gas must be properly disposed of in an authorized facility in accord with all
applicable local, state, and federal laws and regulations.

Filtration systems are commonly used during oil and gas operations in North Dakota. The Commission is very
concerned about the proper disposal of used filters (including filter socks) used by the oil and gas industry.

Effective June 1, 2014, a container must be maintained on each well drilled in North Dakota beginning when the
well is spud and must remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations
are conducted. The on-site container must be used to store filters until they can be properly disposed of in an
authorized facility. Such containers must be:

e leakproof to prevent any fluids from escaping the container

e covered to prevent precipitation from entering the container

e placard to indicate only filters are to be placed in the container

If the operator will not utilize a filtration system, a waiver to the container requirement will be considered, but
only upon the operator submitting a Sundry Notice (Form 4) justifying their request.

As previously stated in our March 13, 2014 letter, North Dakota Administrative Code Section 33-20-02.1-01
states in part that every person who transports solid waste (which includes oil and gas exploration and production
wastes) is required to have a valid permit issued by the North Dakota Department of Health, Division of Waste
Management. Please contact the Division of Waste Management at (701) 328-5166 with any questions on the
solid waste program. Note oil and gas exploration and production wastes include produced water, drilling mud,
invert mud, tank bottom sediment, pipe scale, filters, and fly ash.

Thank you for your cooperation.
