STRIPPER WELL DETERMINATION

Dear Ms, Vogl:

SM Energy Company (SM Energy) filed with the North Dakota Industrial Commission — Oil and
Gas Division (Commission) on September 12, 2011 an application for a Stripper \ Well Property
Determination for the above captioned well.

Information contained in the application indicates that the above mentioned well is a property
pursuant to statute and rule, and SM Energy has elected to designate said well as a separate
property for stripper well purposes. The well produced from a well depth greater than 10000
feet. During the qualifying period, February 1, 2009 through January 31, 2010 the well produced
at a maximum efficient rate and the average daily production from the well was 26.5 barrels of
oil per day during this period.

It is therefore determined that the above captioned well qualifies as a “Stripper Well Property”
pursuant to Section 57-51.1-01 of the North Dakota Century Code. This determination is
applicable only to the Madison Pool in and under said property.

The Commission shall have continuing jurisdiction, and shall have the authority to review the

matter, and to amend or rescind the determination if such action is supported by additional or

newly discovered information. If you have any questions, do not hesitate to contact me.

Spill Prevention Measures for Pipelines

File Number: 11745 Basic Game & Fish 34-3

Schematic on a map showing the location and route of the pipelines:

See attached Site Diagram, indicating the location of the pipelines. At this LESS

facility, the “pipelines” are buried flowlines which connect the wellhead to the
production facilities (heater treater and storage tanks). All flowlines are Jocated within
the boundaries of the well pad. The treater and storage tanks are surrounded by their own
dike (see “Dikes and their capacities”).

Pipeline Information:

Flow line - (Buried) 3” steel threaded line pipe (Schedule 40)
WP. - 3,600 psi

Oil Fill line — (Above ground) 3” steel threaded line pipe (Schedule 40}
WP — 3,600 psi

Salt water fill line - (Above ground) 2” steel threaded line pipe (Schedule 40)
WP — 2,650 psi

Recycle line (Above ground) 2” steel! threaded linc pipe (Schedule 40)
WP — 2,650 psi

Age: 20 years (completed 1/19/86)
Monitoring Systems installed: None
Surveillance Programs in place: None
Inspection and Maintenance Programs in place:

This is a two-wellsite location with two separate production facilities on location. Oil
and produced water flow from two producing wells, the M&G 14-2 and the Basic Game
& Fish 34-3, into and out of pressure vessels and to bulk storage by interconnecting
piping. The piping may be either above or below ground, but does not extend past the
outer boundaries of the wellsite. Production operations personne! perform routine
operational (visual) examinations on above ground interconnecting piping for indication
of leaks, abnormalities, or equipment malfunctions during their daily visit to the facility.
Below ground flowlines are walked and a visual examination is performed for
indications of a leak if a production shortage shows the need. Records of daily checks
are recorded on gauge sheets. Periodic, comprehensive flowline inspections are
performed by Nance Petroleum personnel and recorded on a well inspection report.
These records are maintained at the Nance Petroleum Williston, ND and Billings, MT
offices.

Dear Mr. Evertz:

Our o ffice has notreceived the digital .tif formatted file for the Drill Time-Sample-Mud Log
Lateral #1. Sidetrack #1, and the Sidetrack #2.

The North Dakota Administrative Code Séction 43-02-03-31 requires that alllogsrun by the
operator shall be submitted as one paper copy and one electronic formatted file. All image logs,
which include the Drill Time-Sample-Mud Log, must be submitted as *.tif formatted files.

The Oil and Gas Division is aware that not all operators or contractors can generate electronic
image logs as *.tif formatted files. In an effort to assist the Operator to comply with the North
Dakota Administrative Code, the NDIC Oil and Gas Division is providing a low cost option. In
lieu of the Operator submitting one paper copy and one digital *.uf formatted file for all image
logs run on each well, you may submit two paper copies along with a $25.00 scanning fee for
each log to be scanned. In return, the Operator will receive an electronic copy of each log
scanned as a TIF(*.tif) formatted file on a CD-ROM.

If you choose to have the NDIC Oil and Gas Division create the electronic file, Ihave included a
Request for Well Scanning Form for younconvenience.

If you have any questions, please contact me at (701) 328-$)20.

WELL EVALUATION

GENERAL

The Nance Petroleum Corporation Basic Game & Fish 34-3H was designed as a
horizontal development well for the Nesson member of the Mississippian Mission
Canyon Formation within the Baker Field. Baker Field is located in the U.S. portion of
the Williston Basin, in McKenzie County, North Dakota. The original Basic Game & Fish
34-3 was drilled directionally (due to surface restrictions on the Missouri River
floodplain) by Basic Earth Science Systems, Inc. in late 1985, reaching total depth in the
Mission Canyon Formation (Mississippian in age), below the Nesson zone. A string of
5.5" production casing was run to total depth after electric logging, and the Nesson zone
was perforated and completed.

The original Game & Fish 34-3 was completed for 98 BOPD, 0 BWPD and 64
MCF gas per day. More recently, Nance Petroleum Corp acquired the well. Recent
production from the Basic Game & Fish 34-3 was 23 BOPD and 6 BWPD. The well has
produced 224,525 BO, 107,142 MCFG and 6,623 BW through mid 2002.

Nance re-entered the Basic Game & Fish 34-3 and milled a window for
sidetracking operations in November 2002. The horizontal leg is refrred to as 34-3H.

The four primary offset wells used for correlation while drilling the Basic Game &
Fish 34-3H are:

1} the original open hole logs from the Basic Earth Science Systems, Inc.
Basic Game & Fish 34-3 (now owned by Nance Petroleum Corp.}, with
the surface location 392’ FSL & 494’ FWL in the SW SW Section 2,
T153N, R101W, McKenzie Co., N.D.

&

the John L. Cox (now owned by Nance Petroleum Corp.) French-
Pinney #24-3, located 660’ FSL & 1,955’ FWL in the SE SW Section 3,
T153N, R101W, McKenzie Co.,N.D. The French-Pinney was drilled
in 1987 and completed in the Red River Formation (Ordovician in age).
The French-Pinney IP’d for 276 BOPD, 486 MCFG, and 0 BWPD, and
has produced over 401,537 BO, 718,456 MCFG, and 193,009 BW.

3) the Nance Petroleum Corp. M&G #14-2 (originally drilled by John L.
Cox in 1987 as the Basic Game & Fish #14-2). The M&G surface
location is on the same pad as the Basic Game & Fish 34-3, spotted at
559’ FSL & 573’ FWL in the SW SW Section 2, T153N, R101W,

A GEOLOGY SERVICE


One portion of Sidetrack #1 that exhibited higher gas readings was noted
between 11,315’ MD and 11,355’ MD. Drillers noted torque and bit bound around
11,370’ MD that may indicate a fractured interval. Gas background levels and the size
of the connection gas and downtime gas spikes was greater following the events at
11,315’ MD to 11,355’ MD and 11,370’ MD. Sidetrack #1 was terminated when the
base of the Midale argillaceous zone was penetrated at a steep up angle.

SIDETRACK #2

Sidetrack #2 was started off of Sidetrack #1 to avoid the encounter with the
“tough drilling” basal Midale. Sidetrack #2 took off from Sidetrack #1 below the 3.5’ to 5’
“hard streak” and the first portion of Sidetrack #2 was drilled in the lower 10° to 12’
stratigraphically of the Nesson porosity. Gas readings were generally higher up to
11,700’ MD than the balance of the drilling of Sidetrack #2. This would seem to indicate
that the shows were better in the lower portion of the Nesson porosity as we reached
out beyond 3,500’ Vertical Section [VS] from the surface location. After tripping for a
fresh bit at 12,040’ MD, the well path was returned to the uppermost 3.5’ to 5’ of the
Nesson. Free oil was noted coming over the shale shaker screens following the bit trip
(associated with the trip gas). Samples recovered from Sidetrack #2 were generally
similar to those described above for Sidetrack #1, but becoming progressively smailer in
size (milled up by the drill pipe while passing through the lateral portion of the hole) and
increasingly coated with free oil from the mud system. Some samples were little more
than an oily paste. In Sidetrack #2, one short excursion into the overlying basal Midale
was experienced and another close encounter (without drilling all the way out of the
Nesson) was likely. Gas readings did depress somewhat with these “out of porosity”
encounters. Interpreted and Gamma Ray - documented top and bottom of zone events
are included in this report in a table that addresses “Dip Estimates’.

Sidetrack #2 was terminated when the legal “hardline setback” was approached, the

MVD batteries failed, and the basal Midale argillaceous marker was penetrated, all at
approximately the same time.

Sidetrack #1 was initiated at 9,460’ MD off of Lateral #1. Sidetrack #1
proceeded in zone, in the upper Nesson porosity, until drilling out of the top of the target
around 11,620’ MD. The decision was made to pull back and sidetrack “in zone’, rather
the waste the time and footage to drill back down to the target. Part of the difficulty with
recovering from drilling out the top of the Nesson is the poor “drill-ability” of the overlying
basal Midale argillaceous marker. “Sliding” (or directionally orienting the well path)
becomes very slow and unproductive. Steering is much more effective within the
Nesson porosity itself. The Sidetrack #1 was terminated at 11,680’ MD, at a position of
970.22’ North & 3,406.95’ West of the surface location. This calculates to a point
approximately 1,362' FSL & 2,371’ FWL in the NE SW of Section 3.

Sidetrack #2 was initiated around 11,400’ MD off of Sidetrack #1. Sidetrack #2
proceeded “in zone” in the Nesson porosity, but initially at a deeper stratigraphic horizon
than Sidetrack #1. The early portion of Sidetrack #2 explored the lower 10’ of the 15’
gross Nesson porosity. A trip for a new bit was made at 12,040’ MD in Sidetrack #2.
Drilling of Sidetrack #2 proceeded after the bit trip mostly in the upper Nesson porosity
until several factors necessitated the termination of the drilling. These factors included
the approaching legal “hardline setback”, dead MWD batteries and the penetration of
the top the Nesson into the overlying basal Midale argillaceous marker. Sidetrack #2
reached total depth at 12,800' MD. The Bottom Hole Location [BHL] at total depth in
Sidetrack #2 was 1,582.72’ North & 4,338.8’ West of the surface location, at
approximately 1,975’ FSL & 1,439’ FWL in the NE SW of Section 3.

Re-entry and horizontai drilling of the Basic Game & Fish #34-3H took 21 days
and ~206 rotating hours. A total of 3,986.35 barrels of water were lost during drilling.
The Nesson laterals were left uncased for an acid stimulation and horizontal completion.

GEOLOGIC EVALUATION

The geologic evaluation of the Basic Game & Fish #34-3H began at the window
milling operation, stratigraphically above the top of the Ratcliffe member of the Charles
Formation (Mississippian in age), at 9,038' MD. Sunburst Consulting provided well site
geologists and a digital data gathering system. The digital gas information was
augmented by the use of a digital gas chromatograph. Drilling rig data (including ROP
[Rate of Penetration], on-off bottom status, and mud pump strokes) was received
through a digital connection to the rig EDR [Electronic Data Recorder]. The Sunburst
gas detection readings were returned for display and monitoring to the rig EDR.
Engineering and geologic data were then compiled and distributed on a digital drafting
and Internet communications system.

BUILD CURVE & LATERAL

After milling the window in the pre-existing 5.5" casing the directional portion of
the Basic Game & Fish #34-3H began. The KOP for the lateral was at 9,038' MD, just
above the top of the Ratcliffe zone of the lower Charles Formation (below the Base Last

Salt).


The Ratcliffe was encountered at 9,078’ MD, 8,970' TVD, (-7107'). There was a
significant hydrocarbon show identified within the Ratcliffe interval between 9,114’ and
9,124’ MD. Gas peaked at 243 units [1% methane in air = 100 units] with large “heavy
gas” components (C3’s & C4s). Elevated backgound gas levels and large connection
and downtime gas spikes were recorded for the balance of the drilling of the Basic
Game & Fish #34-3H that are attributed (at least in part) to this zone. Samples
recovered from this Ratcliffe show interval included Limestone: light to occasional
medium brown, tan, very fine crystalline, occasional pefoidal, occasional spotty black oil
stain, dull green fluorescence, slow streaming cut in part, poor to very poor
intercrystalline and interparticle porosity, occasionally anhydritic. These shows were
considered exceptional for the Ratcliffe interval in this area, and warrant further
investigation.

The Midale interval (also a member of the Charles Formation) was topped at
9,189’ MD, 9,056' TVD, (-7193'). There were only trace sample shows observed within
the Midale, with no significant gas increases over the high Ratcliffe background.

The top of the Mission Canyon Formation (Nesson zone) was reached at 9,350’
MD, 9,127.9' TVD (-7264.9') in the curve building portion of the lateral. Samples from
the initial contact with the Nesson porosity contained Limestone: tan, cream, very fine
crystalline, fragmental, occasionally peloidal, spotty black oil stain in vugs, yellow
fluorescence in part, slow streaming cut in part, very poor interparticle and small pin
point vuggy porosity, occasional white to clear anhydrite & calcite crystals. Surface oil
(free oil on the samples) was observed, probably coming from produced oil in the drilling
fluid (mud). A trip gas spike of 1,802 units was recorded when the steerable assembly
was tripped into the hole at 9,475' MD. Due to an unexpectedly aggressive angle build
in the last portion of the curve build, the top of the Nesson was once again encountered
at 9,521’ MD, 9,127’ TVD as the well path moved back up stratigraphically.

SIDETRACK #1

Sidetrack #1 was initiated to avoid the sharp upward climb of the end of Lateral
#1. Sidetrack #1 remained predominately within the top 5’ of the Nesson porosity, and
oscillating between the top of the Nesson and the relative “hard streak” delineating the
base of the uppermost 3.5’ to 5’ (stratigraphically) of the Nesson porosity. The well path
did traverse up into the base of the Midale on two occasions, but it was possible to steer
back down into the targeted Nesson porosity. A tabulation of the encounters with the
top of the Nesson / base of the Midale and with the “hard streak” 3.5-5’ down from the
top of the Nesson is presented in the table “Dip Estimates”. Some of the recorded
events are based on Gamma Ray markers, while others (generally the “hard streak”)
are interpreted from drill rate and natural inflections of the well path. Samples from the
upper Nesson porosity were generally limestone: tan, cream, very fine crystalline,
fragmental, occasional peloidal, spotty biack oil stain in vugs, yellow fluorescence, slow

to fast streaming cut in part, very poor interparticle and pin point vuggy porosity, with
some white to clear anhydrite and calcite crystals.

A GEOLOGY SERVICE

DIP ESTIMATES

Average formation dips were calculated using the multiple contact points with
known (or suspected) equivalent stratigraphic markers. The estimates are “straight line”
extrapolations, but serve to give an approximate average dip. The large variation in the
dip estimates may be due to drilling the lateral along the edge of the structure, or minor
short term variations in the dip.

SUMMARY

The Basic Game & Fish #34-3H was successfully steered to a horizontal
penetration of the Nesson zone of the Mission Canyon Formation. The lateral exposed
a net 3,800' foliowing the initial penetrations of the top of the Nesson. The vast majority
lateral is interpreted to have been drilled within the Nesson, in or stratigraphically near
the Nesson “porosity”. The Basic Game & Fish #34-3H required 21 drilling days or
approximately 206 drilling hours. The drilling operation generally went smoothly, with
few delays or problems. General sample quality (e.g. How representative were the
samples recovered ?) was rated as fair to poor due to very fine cuttings size out in the
lateral. The show quality in the lateral was fair to good, with obvious oil staining and
visible open porosity.

CONCLUSIONS
1) A window was milled in the original 5.5" casing for directional sidetracking.
2) A significant show was encountered in the Ratcliffe, which persistently

produced gas during the drilling of the well.

3) The Nance Basic Game & Fish #34-3H was successfully steered to a
horizontal trajectory in the targeted Nesson zone of the Mission Canyon
Formation. Two open hole sidetracks were performed to keep the well
path in the target zone.

4) There were 3,800' measured depth feet drilled in the lateral following the
initial penetration of the Nesson. Of the total footage drilled after initial
penetration of the Nesson target 3,249’ (or 85.5%) were drilled in or very
near the targeted porosity streak, 68’ (or1.8%) were drilled just below the
target streak, and 483’ (or 12.7%) were drilled just above the ideal target.

5) Sample show and visual porosity estimates indicated fair to good
hydrocarbon production potential for the lateral. Fluid losses and free oil
in the mud and on the samples also indicate permeability and movable oil
phase.

6) The Nance Basic Game & Fish #34-3H awaits open hole completion in the

Nesson lateral following an acid stimulation with the drilling rig after TD.

Re: Notice of Intent to Revise Directional Plan
Basic Game & Fish #34-3 Well
SW/SW Sec. 2, TiS3N-R101W
McKenzie Co., ND
Baker Field

Gentlemen:

Included with this letter, please find the required copies of the above referenced
NOI to Revise Directional Plan for the horizontal sidetrack of this well in the Nesson
porosity zone of the Madison formation. As per discussions with Mr. Kelly Triplett of
your office, this revised plan is proposed to insure that the horizontal wellbore
encounters the Nesson porosity at a distance of 505’ or more from the south line of
Section 3, T153N-R101W. This revision is necessary due to discrepancies between the
original directional surveys for tbis well during initial drilling of the well and the
directional gyro survey run in this well just prior to initiating the horizontal sidetrack of
this well.

Please contact me if you have additional questions concerning this proposal,

Sinccrely,

lle.) babe.

DETAILS OF WORK
Nance Petroleum Corporation submits the attached revised directional driiling plan for the proposed Nesson zone
horizontal sidetrack of this well. The directional drilling plan has been revised to insure that the horizontal welibore
will be greater than 505' FSL of Sec. 3, T153N-R101W when the top of the Nesson porosity is reached. The top of the
Nesson porosity is anticipated to be encountered at a TVD of 9,124' at a point 544' FSL of Sec. 3 based on the revised
directional drilling plan.

RE: Workover Project Determination
Basic Game & Fish #34-3

SW SW Sec. 2-T153N-R101W
Well File #11745

Dear Mr. Evertz:

On June 30, 1997, Panterra Petroleum filed a notice of intent to begin a
workover project on the above listed well with the North Dakota Industrial
Commission. The workover project was completed on September 16, 1997 and
meets the requirements set forth in North Dakota Century Code Section
57-51.1-03.

The workover project was performed from September 9, 1997 to
September 16, 1997. The total cost of the project was $29,075. The
average daily production prior to commencement of the workover project from
December 1996 through May 1997 was 23.5 barrels of oil per day. The
average daily production during the first sixty days after completion of the
workover project was 38.7 barrels of oil per day.

Therefore, it is delermined the above listed well qualifies as a
workover project for tax exemption purposes. The Commission shall have
continuing jurisdiction, and shall have the authority to review the matter.
The determination may be amended or rescinded by the Commission for good

cause.
Sincerely,
Kent Fetzer

Dear Mr. Jones:

Upon a recent inspection of the above captioned wells, I noted the following prob-
lems:

Basic Game & Fish #34-3 ~- reclamation of the drilling pit must be completed
immediately. The ignitor is not working and must be repaired as soon as
possible. Additionally, there is an area around the production equipment
that is very weedy and is a potential fire hazard.

Rosebud #22-11 - ignitor was not working. Also weeds on the location that
need to be removed.

Basic Corps of Engineers #31-10 ~ the drilling pit mud cuttings must be hauled
out to an approved disposal pit and the drilling pit on location reclaimed
immediately.

Please take care of these problems as soon as possible. If you have any questions,
feel free to contact our office.

Sincerely,

Tem Del l ng feb

Comments relative to DST #1 run on Game & Fish #34-3 in McKenzie

County, North Dakota, Sec. 3- 157N- 101W for Basic Earth Science
Systems Inc.

The calculations here-in performed were accomplished by plotting the
time and pressure data on semi-log scale and using the resulting
Slope and extrapolated pressures from the Horner plot. i

she initial. formation pressure extrapolated to 4490 psi with a slope

of 243 psi/cycle creating a sub-surface pressure gradient of .488
psi/ft. at the recorder depth of 9206 feet.

The average effective permeability for this zone calculated to 2.32 md.

This was based on 911 feet of 40 API gravity oil being recovered in
100 minutes flowing time. The entire second flow was restricted,
making the fluid recovery and reported gas flow rate low. With the
information available, it is impossible to pinpoint the true flow
rate, permeability, or gas-oil ratio. It is quite possible that this
test could have flowed to surface. The skin factor and damage ratio
numbers are high due to tool restriction and do not suggest any
Significant well-bore damage was present at the time of this test.

If you should have any questions concerning this test, please do not
hesitate to call. We appreciate your work and look forward to serving
you again.

Proposed Circulating Medium

The type and characteristics of the proposed circulating mud system will
be gel chemical/inverted with adequate stocks of sorptive agents and
other materials on-site to handle any anticipated down hele problem, as
well as possible spills of fuel and oil on surface.

9100-TD 9.5-10.6 28-50 1/4 12 for DST's

The surface hole and first 3000' will be drilled with fresh water, using
gel pills as needed to keep hole clean. The saturation of the mud will
then be allowed to increase to saturated before drilling the Pine Salt at
6822'. The system will be kept salt saturated to TD.

Testing, Logging and Coring Programs (Proposed, depending shows )

A. Drill Stem Tests will be made in any formation indicating conmercial
production.

B. Logs run will be an Integrated Sonic Log from 2000' to total depth;
a Dual Induction Log from surface to total depth; and a FDC/CNL Log
from approximately 6000' to total depth.

C. A two man mud logging unit will be on location from 8500' to TD.

D. No cores are anticipated.

E. We do not anticipate using fracture treatment.

F. Directional surveys will be taken every 500' from surface to TD and
the connection above any anticipated salts and the connection below
the Pine and Charles salts.
