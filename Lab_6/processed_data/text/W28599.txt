GEOLOGIC EVALUATION

Methods:

Geologic supervision of the Chalmers 5301 44-24 3BR was provided by Sunburst Consulting,
Inc. with two well site geologists. A digital gas detector and chromatograph were interfaced with
a Pason electronic data recorder system. The unit of measure for gas on this well was units (u),
which was defined as 100 units equaling 1% methane equivalent in air. The EDR provided drill
rate, on-off bottom and pump strokes to the gas detection computer and received total gas
information from Sunburst for viewing around location. Lagged samples were caught by the rig

siltstone, limestone and silty sandstone (Figures 6 & 7). Trace spotty light brown oil staining was
common.

Figure 5, 6 & 7: Wet cuttings of the Upper Bakken Shale (left), Middle Bakken siltstone (center) and Middle
Bakken silty sandstone (right) at 10X (photos by Kate Schwehr, wellsite geologist).

Geo-steering:

Kick-off point for the curve was established from the isopach of the “base last salt” marker to the
Middle Bakken “target” in the offset wells. The Chalmers 5301 44-24 2TR was used as the
primary offset through the vertical and curve sections. While drilling the curve, measured
gamma ray signatures were compared to those of the three offsets and aided in the landing of the
curve. The landing target was confirmed by the depth of the False Bakken, which was consistent
with the offset wells. The curve was successfully landed within the Middle Bakken Member at a
depth of 10,939’ MD (10,621’ TVD) placing the well bore approximately 9’ below the top of the
Middle Bakken Formation. Directional tools were then pulled out of the hole and a string of 7”
casing was set (10,898’ MD) and then cemented by Schlumberger.

Samples from the target zone varied in porosity, oil staining, color, cementation, and pyrite
content. Stratigraphic location in the target zone was based on these sample observations along
with gas shows, drill rates and gamma ray values. Severe doglegs were to be avoided so as to
obtain the desired vertical section and aid in a successful completion liner run at TD.

The Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC prospect geologist defined the an initial target zone
as an 13’ zone that began 11’ below the base of the Upper Bakken Shale and ended 16’ above
the top of the Lower Bakken Shale. The target zone consisted of an upper silty sandstone interval
reading 90-140 count gamma (A marker). The center of the target interval was comprised of
slightly less silty sandstone reading 80-140 count gamma (B marker). Underlying the B Marker
was another sandstone layer with gamma readings of 80-120 (C marker). The A-C gamma
markers were used for determining depth within the target interval and plotted on the Chalmers
5301 44-24 3BR dip profile (Figure 9).

crew in 30’ intervals from 8,200’ MD to 10,780’ MD, 10’ intervals from 10,780’ MD to 10,939”
MD, and 30’ intervals from 10,939’ MD to 20,833’ TD. Wet and dry cuttings were examined
under a tri-ocular microscope and complete lithologic descriptions and sampling intervals are
provided in the lithology document within this evaluation. The set of dry cuttings collected
during the duration of the well were sent to the State of North Dakota. Evidence of light
hydrocarbons present in the drilling fluid was reported by the gas chromatography equipment
and documented on the mud log presented with this report.

Zones of Interest:

The Mission Canyon Formation (Mississippian; Madison Group) was drilled at 9,291’ TVD
(-7,323’) and is comprised largely of light gray lime mudstone followed by gray to tan earthy
textured argillaceous lime mudstone. Shows within the Mission Canyon ranged from 20 to 94
units against 9.8 ppg mud.

Figure 3 & 4: Wet cutting of the Lodgepole Formation (left) and False Bakken sub-interval (right) at 10X.

The top of the Lodgepole Formation was logged at 9,849’ TVD (-7,881’). In general the
Lodgepole can be described as a medium to dark gray brown argillaceous lime mudstone with a
crystalline texture and trace amounts of disseminated pyrite (Figure 3). The False Bakken
(Carrington Shale), drilled at 10,584’ TVD (-8,616’), is comprised of very dark brown to black,
slightly pyritic shale with an earthy texture, and was found to be soft to firm (Figure 4). Strong
hydrocarbon shows in the lower 100’ of the Lodgepole were as high as 920 total gas units;
suggest that some of the oil and gas from the Upper Bakken Shale may be exploiting fractures
thought to exist in the Lower Lodgepole.

The Bakken Formation (Devonian — Mississippian) has four formal members, an upper and
lower black, fissile, organic-rich pyritic shale, separated by an arenaceous limestone, siltstone
and silty sandstone middle member. These three members overlay a silty shale or siltstone of the
Pronghorn Member toward the basin depositional center. The Upper Bakken Shale was drilled at
10,592’ TVD (-8,624’) with sample returns typically described as black, carbonaceous,
petroliferous shale with trace amounts of disseminated pyrite (Figure 5). The Middle Bakken,
penetrated at 10,612’ TVD (-8,644’), consists of a varying thickness and sequence of interbedded

Figure 8: Offset gamma ray profile of the Middle Bakken (0-100 api. scale) *See dip profile (Figure 9) for
marker presentation*

Using the aforementioned information gathered during drilling, offset log information and the
structural data provided from Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC., well site geologists were
able to anticipate, and interpret the local apparent dip during the drilling of the Chalmers 5301
44-24 3BR well. A total depth of 20,833’ MD was reached on September 16, 2014 at 12:30
CDT. The target resultant was 100% within the Middle Bakken Member. The resulting structure
of the Middle Bakken was a drop in TVD of 87.90’ over 9,983’ MD; resulting in an overall 0.50
down dip as portrayed on the Chalmers 5301 44-24 3BR dip profile (Figure 9).

Gas monitoring and fluid gains were monitored to evaluate the viability of this reservoir during
the drilling of the Chalmers 5301 44-24 3BR well. In the invert mud system, hydrostatic
conditions were maintained near balance. This allowed for gas and fluid gains from the well to
be monitored. Gas shows were encountered in vertical, curve and lateral drilling of the well.

Background gas observed during the drilling of the lateral ranged from 1,000 to 3,000 units.
Invert drilling fluid was used throughout the drilling of the vertical and curve weighing 9.8-11.7
ppg. The lateral was drilled with saline drilling fluid with a mud weight of 9.7-10.15 ppg. Gas
shows ranged up to 3,728 units and connection gases were observed up to 3,620 units. C1-C4 gas
components were observed throughout the course of the lateral. Trip gases were observed as high
as 5,976 units. Oil shows were very light throughout the lateral ranging from 0-3% in sample.
When present it was a light brown spotty oil stain that yielded a slow to moderate streaming to
diffuse pale yellow cut fluorescence.

SUMMARY

The Nabors B25 drilling rig successfully drilled a two-section horizontal well bore within the
Three Forks Formation at the Chalmers 5301 44-24 3BR. A net of 9,894’ was drilled within the
Middle Bakken. A mud program consisting of diesel invert (9.8-11.7 ppg), during the vertical
and curve build sections, and saline based mud (9.7-10.15 ppg), during the lateral maintained
stable hole conditions and permitted adequate analysis of gas concentrations.

Projections of dip were successfully used to maintain the well bore in the Middle Bakken
Member target for 85% of the lateral. Samples from the target consisted of a light to medium
gray, light to medium gray-brown silty sandstone with trace to occasional amounts of
disseminated pyrite and calcite cement. Intergranular porosity was generally seen throughout
the entire lateral. Hydrocarbon shows in the target zone were high throughout the lateral.
Samples from the ideal zone contained a spotty light brown oil stain.

The Chalmers 5301 44-24 3BR will be fitted with a 4 %” production liner and swell packers in
preparation for a fracture stimulation that will determine the true commercial value of the well.
The well currently awaits fracture stimulation.

LITHOLOGY

Rig crews caught lagged samples in 30’ intervals under the supervision of Sunburst geologists. A
detailed list of sampling intervals is included in the well data summary page. Sample or gamma ray
marker tops have been inserted in the sample descriptions below for reference. Samples were examined
wet and dry under a trinocular microscope. The drilling fluid was diesel-based invert from surface
casing to intermediate casing, while salt water drilling fluid was used throughout the lateral. Sample
collection began at 8,200’ MD.

McKenzie County
Well File # 28599

Dear Heather:

Pursuant to Commission Order No. 23752, approval to drill the above captioned well is hereby given. The
approval is granted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than
the 500' setback from the north & south boundaries and 200' setback from the east & west boundaries within the
1280 acre spacing unit consisting of Sections 19 & 20 T153N R100W.

PERMIT STIPULATIONS: DUE TO STREAM ADJACENT TO THE WELL SITE, A DIKE IS
REQUIRED SURROUNDING THE ENTIRE LOCATION. Effective June 1, 2014, a covered leak-
proof container (with placard) for filter sock disposal must be maintained on the well site beginning
when the well is spud, and must remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever
filtration operations are conducted. In cases where a spacing unit is accessed from an off-site drill pad,
an affidavit must be provided affirming that the surface owner of the multi-well pad agrees to accept
burial on their property of the cuttings generated from drilling the well(s) into an offsite spacing/ drilling
unit. OASIS PETRO NO AMER must contact NDIC Field Inspector Richard Dunn at 701-770-3554
ptior to setting conductor.

Drilling pit

NDAC 43-02-03-19.4 states that “a pit may be utilized to bury drill cuttings and solids generated during well
drilling and completion operations, providing the pit can be constructed, used and reclaimed in a manner that will
prevent pollution of the land surface and freshwaters. Reserve and circulation of mud system through earthen pits
are prohibited. All pits shall be inspected by an authorized representative of the director prior to lining and use.
Drill cuttings and solids must be stabilized in a manner approved by the director prior to placement in a cuttings

pit.”

Form 1 Changes & Hard Lines
Any changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC.
The proposed directional plan is at a legal location. The minimum legal coordinate from the well head at casing

point is: 445’ east. Also, based on the azimuth of the proposed lateral the maximum legal coordinates from the
well head are: 426’ south and 10558’ east.

Location Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period)

Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the
approved drilling permit on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report. If circumstances require operations to
commence before the 3rd business day following publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may
be waived by the Director. Application for a waiver must be by sworn affidavit providing the information
necessary to evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(, and any other
information that would allow the Director to conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the
drilling permit, the applicant should retain the permit.

Permit Fee & Notification

Payment was received in the amount of $100 via credit card .The permit fee has been received. It is requested
that notification be given immediately upon the spudding of the well. This information should be relayed to the
Oil & Gas Division, Bismarck, via telephone. The following information must be included: Well name, legal
location, permit number, drilling contractor, company representative, date and time of spudding. Office hours are
8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. Central Time. Our telephone number is (701) 328-8020, leave a
message if after hours or on the weekend.

Survey Requirements for Horizontal, Horizontal Re-entry, and Directional Wells

NDAC Section 43-02-03-25 (Deviation Tests and Directional Surveys) states in part (that) the survey contractor
shall file a certified copy of all surveys with the director free of charge within thirty days of completion. Surveys
must be submitted as one electronic copy, or in a form approved by the director. However, the director may
require the directional survey to be filed immediately after completion if the survey is needed to conduct the
operation of the director's office in a timely manner. Certified surveys must be submitted via email in one adobe
document, with a certification cover page to certsurvey@nd.gov.
Survey points shall be of such frequency to accurately determine the entire location of the well bore.
Specifically, the Horizontal and Directional well survey frequency is 100 feet in the vertical, 30 feet in the curve
(or when sliding) and 90 feet in the lateral.

Surface casing cement

Tail cement utilized on surface casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi within 12
hours, and tail cement utilized on production casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi
before drilling the plug or initiating tests.

Logs

NDAC Section 43-02-03-31 requires the running of (1) a suite of open hole logs from which formation tops and
porosity zones can be determined, (2) a Gamma Ray Log run from total depth to ground level elevation of the well bore, and
(3) a log from which the presence and quality of cement can be determined (Standard CBL or Ultrasonic cement evaluation
log) in every well in which production or intermediate casing has been set, this log must be run prior to completing the well.
All logs run must be submitted free of charge, as one digital TIFF (tagged image file format) copy and one digital LAS (log
ASCH) formatted copy. Digital logs may be submitted on a standard CD, DVD, or attached to an email sent to
digitallogs@nd.gov

DETAILS OF WORK

Oasis Petroleum North America LLC requests permission for suspension of drilling for up to 90 days for the
referenced well under NDAC 43-02-03-55. Oasis Petroleum North America LLC intends to drill the surface hole with
freshwater based drilling mud and set surface casing with a small drilling rig and move off within 3 to 5 days. The
casing will be set at a depth pre-approved by the NDIC per the Application for Permit to Drill NDAC 43-02-03-21. No
saltwater will be used in the drilling and cementing operations of the surface casing. Once the surface casing is
cemented, a plug or mechanical seal will be placed at the top of the casing to prevent any foreign matter from getting
into the well. A rig capable of drilling to TD will move onto the location within the 90 days previously outlined to
complete the drilling and casing pian as per the APD. The undersigned states that this request for suspension of
drilling operations in accordance with the Subsection 4 of Section 43-02-03-55 of the NDAC, is being requested to
take advantage of the cost savings and time savings of using an initial rig that is smaller than the rig necessary to
drill a well to total depth but is not intended to alter or extend the terms and conditions of, or suspend any obligation
under, any oil and gas lease with acreage in or under the spacing or drilling unit for the above-referenced well. Oasis
Petroleum North America LLC understands NDAC 43-02-03-31 requirements regarding confidentiality pertaining to
this permit. The drilling pit will be fenced immediately after construction if the well pad is located in a pasture (NDAC
43-02-03-19 & 19.1). Oasis Petroleum North America LL will plug and abandon the well and reclaim the well site if the
well is not drilled by the larger rotary rig within 90 days after spudding the well with the smaller drilling rig.

inaccuracies are not considered when determining compliance with the spacing/drilling unit boundary setback requirement except in the
following scenarios: 1) When the angle between the well bore and the respective boundary is 10 degrees or less; or 2) If Industry standard
methods and equipment are not utilized. Consult the applicable field order for exceptions.

If measurement inaccuracies are required to be considered, a 2° MWD measurement inaccuracy will be applied to the horizontal portion of the well
bore. This measurement inaccuracy is applied to the well bore from KOP to TD.

OIL AND GAS DIVISION

RE: Filter Socks and Other Filter Media
Leakproof Container Required
Oil and Gas Wells

Dear Operator,

North Dakota Administrative Code Section 43-02-03-19.2 states in part that all waste material associated with
exploration or production of oil and gas must be properly disposed of in an authorized facility in accord with all
applicable local, state, and federal laws and regulations.

Filtration systems are commonly used during oil and gas operations in North Dakota. The Commission is very
concerned about the proper disposal of used filters (including filter socks) used by the oil and gas industry.

Effective June 1, 2014, a container must be maintained on each well drilled in North Dakota beginning when the
well is spud and must remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations
are conducted. The on-site container must be used to store filters until they can be properly disposed of in an
authorized facility. Such containers must be:

e leakproof to prevent any fluids from escaping the container

e covered to prevent precipitation from entering the container

e placard to indicate only filters are to be placed in the container

If the operator will not utilize a filtration system, a waiver to the container requirement will be considered, but
only upon the operator submitting a Sundry Notice (Form 4) justifying their request.

As previously stated in our March 13, 2014 letter, North Dakota Administrative Code Section 33-20-02.1-01
states in part that every person who transports solid waste (which includes oil and gas exploration and production
wastes) is required to have a valid permit issued by the North Dakota Department of Health, Division of Waste
Management. Please contact the Division of Waste Management at (701) 328-5166 with any questions on the
solid waste program. Note oil and gas exploration and production wastes include produced water, drilling mud,
invert mud, tank bottom sediment, pipe scale, filters, and fly ash.

Thank you for your cooperation.

Sincerely,

Brace E. Fichs
