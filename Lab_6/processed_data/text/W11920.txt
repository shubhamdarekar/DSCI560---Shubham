Our conversation on May 2, 2014 discussed flood preparations for wells that your company operates
near Williston, North Dakota. The Missouri River continues to rise and the possibility of additional
flooding from the spring melt and recent rains in the near future exists. | urge you to closely monitor
these sites and take the necessary preventative actions to eliminate or mitigate environmental damage
if these sites become deluged with flood waters. The following e-mail from Allen Schlag of the National
Weather Service also addresses the current situation of the Missouri River in the Williston area:

Subject: Missouri River

Greetings everyone

Just a quick note on the Missouri River near Williston forecast site and the prospects for problems as
we go forward into latter half of May and early June (by default this also includes the Yellowstone in
ND as well). As you may have noticed already, the Missouri River near Williston crossed over into
Forecast Issuance Stage this past weekend before falling back below 20 ft. This, is temporary. While
the Corps released a statement last week tempering their runoff expectations for the Missouri River
overall, the attached graphic of mountain snowpack suggests we still have a pretty strong runoff into
the Yellowstone and Missouri Rivers ahead of us.

We will most likely cross over above flood stage as measured at the Lewis and Clark Bridge west of
Williston at some point in the next couple of weeks.

What exactly lies in store for the area with respect to eventual river stages is still quite unclear as the
overall environment for the melt of the mountain snowpack is too far out. However...there has been
a fairly wet pattern in the plains of Montana already this spring, with a mixed bag in the upper
elevations of central MT. The region remains well above normal with respect to mountain snowpack,
but is also well below where 1997 and 2011 were at this point in time (see the second attached pdf).

if | had to take a wild guess this far in advance, something around the 22.5 to 24.5 ft range is
reasonable, with any added big rains this could be expanded quite easily to the 25-26 ft range.

How exactly this will compare to this spring's ice jams and high water is a really good question, which |
don't have any easy answers to either. Suffice to say, | think there's a pretty decent chance that we
will see water roughly 4-6 ft higher than is currently in northwestern ND along both the Yellowstone
and Missouri Rivers with the timing of near the last week of May to about the third week of June.
Historically, | know there have been some access issues with oil well sites in the Trenton area with
water levels in the 22 ft range at the Lewis and Clark Bridge. How much of this has been mitigated by
ring dikes or road raises, again...very good question to which | have no answer.

Of course, if you have any questions or just want to chat about this in greater detail, always feel free
to give me a call.

Allen

Stripper Well Property Determination for the above captioned well.

Information contained in the application indicates that the above mentioned well is a property

for stripper well purposes. The well produccd from a well depth greater than 10000 feet. During
the qualifying period, October 1, 2007 through September 30, 2008 the well produced at a

applicable only to the Duperow Pool in and under said property.

The Commission shall have continuing jurisdiction, and shall have the authority to review the

Sincerely,

either above or below ground, but does not extend past the outer boundaries of the
wellsite. Production operations personnel perform routine operational (visual)
examunations on above ground interconnecting piping for indication of leaks,
abnormalities, or equipment malfunctions during their daily visit to the facility. Below
ground flowlines are walked and a visual examination is performed for indications of a
leak if 4 production shortage shows the need. Records of daily checks are recorded on
gauge sheets. Periodic, comprehensive flowline inspections are performed by Nance

DETAILS OF WORK

Nance Petroleum request permission to permanently abandon the Red River and production test the Duperow.
A previous workover in May and June 1999 attempted to stimulate the Red River, but failed due to collapsed
casing in the Prairie Saft and Dunham formations. Communication was lost with the producing zone during the
workover due to salt plugs in the various fish left in the well. See the attached wellbore schematic.
Approximately $156,000 was spent trying to re-establish production from the Red River. The well has salted off
again and is not productive. We propose to spot 30 sx Class 'G' cement on top of the Mode! ’D' packer to
permanently abandon the Red River. Due to the tight casing in the Dunham, 6661’, we can not get a retainer in
the well, and with out communication with the perfs, we can not get a squeeze. We request a verbal approval
as we intend to start this work this week due to lease expirations

again and Is not productive. We propose to spot 30 sx Class ‘G’ cement on top of the Model 'D’ packer to
permanenlly abandon the Red River. Due to the tight casing in the Dunham, 6661’, we can not get a retainer in
the well, and with out communication with the perfs, we can nol get a squeeze. We request @ verbal approval
as we intend 1o start this work this week due to lease expirations

March 8, 1996

Ms. Jan Magstadt
Panterra Petroleum

P. O. Box 7168

Billings, MT 59103-7168

Dear Ms. Magstadt:

Panterra Petroleum filed with the Industrial Commission on
March 7, 1996 an application for a Stripper Well Property
Determination for its Corps of Engineers #31-10 well (Well File
#11920, API #33-053-02148) located in the NW NE 10-153N-101W,
McKenzie County, North Dakota.

Information contained in the application indicates that the
above mentioned well is a property pursuant to statute and rule,
and Panterra Petroleum has elected to designate said well as a
separate property for stripper well purposes. Also, the well
produces from a well depth of more than 10,000 feet. During the
twelve consecutive months qualifying period January 1995 thru
December 1995, the well produced at a maximum efficient rate, and
the average daily production from the well was 27.9 barrels of oil
per day.

It is therefore determined that the above mentioned well
qualifies as a "Stripper Well Property” pursuant to Section
57-51.1-01 NDCC.

This determination is applicable only to the Red River Pool
in and under said property.

The Commission shall have continuing jurisdiction, and shall
have the authority to review the matter. The determination may be
amended or rescinded by the Commission for good cause.

Sincerely,

‘

Mr. Gary Evertz Workover Project Determination

Operations Manager Corps of Engineers #31-10
Panterra Petroleum NWNE 10-153N-101W

P.O. Box 7168 McKenzie County, ND
Billings, MT 59103-7168 Well File No. 11920

Dear Mr. Evertz:

On June 13, 1994, Panterra Petroleum filed a notice of intent
to begin a workover project on the above listed well with the North
Dakota Industrial Commission. The workover project was completed
on June 20, 1994 and meets the requirements set forth in North
Dakota Century Code Section 57-51.1=-03.

The workover project was performed from June 13, 1994 to June 20,
1994. The total cost of the project was $39,239. The average
daily production from the well prior to commencement of the
workover project from December 1993 through May 1994 was 24.53
barrels of oil per day. The average daily production from the well
during the first sixty days after completion of the project was
72.37 barrels of oil per day.

Therefore, it is determined the above listed well qualifies as a
workover project for tax exemption purposes.

The Commission shall have continuing jurisdiction, and shall have

the authority to review the matter. The determination may be
amended or rescinded by the Commission for good cause.

Sincerely,

ate ie

Petroleum Engineer

DETAILS OF WORK .

On June 2, 1994, the well developed a tubing leak and a rig was moved on June 8, 1994. While
pulling the rods and pump, scale was noted and it was decided that work in addition to repair
of tubing leak should be done. Panterra proposes to replace rod cut tbg, lower pump, and acid
stimulate the Red River. Replaceing the 456 pumping unit with a larger unit will be required
when the pump is lowered,

Dear Mr. Jones:

I have recently spoken with State Field Inspector Tom Delling about the
reserve pit at the Basie Corps of Engineers #31-10. We feel all the material
from the pit should be removed to a legal waste disposal system. I
understand most has been removed already. This is a sensitive area as far
as the high water table, and the possible flooding of the Missouri River. We
felt this should have been a lined pit. A sample of the water in the pit
showed 70,000 PPM. There is a possibility this could contaminate the area.

We will require the pit to be reclaimed this fall. If you have any
question, please feel free to contact me.

Sincerely,

Please be advised that we are requiring that a closed system be installed on the
Rosebud #22-11. You may either tie in the tank vent lines to the flare pit or
install a vapor recovery system. This is due to the close proximity of the rifle
range and previous problems with gas caming off the top of the tanks. Please

take care of this immediately.

Also, it is our understanding that you encountered problems with your casing pro-
gram on the Basic Corps of Eng #31-10 well. Please submit a Form 4 detailing
the problems and what was done to rectify the problems. Thank you.

Dear Mr. Delling:

We are in receipt of your letter of October 20, 1986, regarding the above-
referenced wells. We have reviewed our production operation both in-house and
with our field personnel and are unaware of any recurring problem with gas
venting off the top of the Rosebud #22-11 tanks. Since this well is hooked
into a gas gales line, we would be anxious to correct this problem. Please
contact me at your earliest convenience 30 we can discuss this perceived
problem and seek a reasonable solution. Any solution to a problem must be
matched with the scope of the problem it is intended to solve, for this reason
I am in need of further input from you to solve this problem.

We are still in the process of repairing the casing problems in the Corps of
Engineers #31-10 well and as soon as that work is completed, we will submit a
form 4 detailing exactly what has been done to date. At this point in time,
we have run a string of casing to the bottom of the hole and are attempting to
verify how well cemented it is.

Please contact me at your convenience 30 we can resolye any problem we may
have. ~

Dear Mr. Jones:

Upon a recent inspection of the above captioned wells, I noted the following prob-
lems:

Basic Game & Fish #34-3 - reclamation of the drilling pit must be completed
immediately. The ignitor is not working and mist be repaired as soon as
possible. Additionally, there is an area around the production equipment
that is very weedy and is a potential fire hazard.

Rosebud #22-11 - ignitor was not working. Also weeds on the location that
need to be removed.

Basic Corps of Engineers #31-10 - the drilling pit mud cuttings must be hauled
out to an approved disposal pit and the drilling pit on location reclaimed
immediately.

Please take care of these problems as soon as possible. If you have any questions,
feel free to contact our office.

Sincerely,

16m Delling. Rb

COMMENTS:
AS NOT ENOUGH OIL WAS RECOVERED TO OBTAIN A RELIABLE UALUE FOR API GRAVITY, IT WAS
ASSUMED THAT THE API GRAVITY OF THE OIL IS 4@ DEG. THE FINAL SHUT~IN PRESSURE BUILD-UP
DATA WAS ANALYZED USING HORNER ANALYSIS FOR DETERMINATION OF P#, KH/U, AND SKIN.
COMPLETION DESIGN SENSITIUITY PLOTS WERE GENERATED FOR UARIOUS FRACTURE HALF-LENGTHS, TO
PREDICT FUTURE PRODUCTION POTENTIAL OF THE ZONE WITH A HYDRAULIC FRACTURE TREATMENT. SEE

Dear Mr. Jones:

As per our conversation on June 16, 1986, neither Ken Kallestad nor Ellis Haake
with the Oil and Gas Division, could confirm the fact that they had a conversation
with you and approved the use of the drilling pit without a liner on the above
captioned location.

The fluids in the pit shall not exceed 3000 ppm TDS. I will be checking the
fresh water pit regularly and if at any time it exceeds 3000 ppm TDS, we will
require that the fluids be removed and a liner installed. Upon completion of
Grilling status, you will be required to remove the fluids and reclaim the pit.
Also, any contaminates noted must be removed immediately.

If you have any questions, feel free to contact our office.

Sincerely,

Field Inspector

WELL PAD AND ACCESS ROAD,
MCKENZIE COUNTY, NORTH DAKOTA ee

by

John and Mavis Greer

LR, (P.1.)

Project No. ND-1946
March 1986

ABSTRACT: An intensive cultural resource survey was conducted on the
area surrounding a proposed well pad and access road. No cultural
resources were found, and cultural clearance is recommended with no
Special stipulations.

PROJECT LOCATION:

Agency: Corp of Engineers, Riverdale

USGS Quad: Williston SW (7.5')

Well Location: NW/NE (660 fnt, 2305 fel) Sec.10-T153N-R101W
Public Surface (5 acres surveyed)

Access Route: NW/NE Section 10
(0.11 miles surveyed, public surface)

PROJECT DESCRIPTION: Construction is planned on a well pad {est. 300 x
35D") and an access road (about 600 feet long). The access road leaves
the bladed county road just to the north and runs south on the west side
of an irrigation canal to the well location. The well pad and access
road are staked in a plowed field which is currently in stubble. This
flat area has been diked and is a controlled farming portion of the
wide Missouri River floodplain.

were found.

No cultural resources

-3-

PROJECT SETTING: The proposed well location is situated on the recent

Missouri River floodplain, in a silty area currently in cultivation. A
large major meander (now a large recreational lake) is just to the south-
east, while the main Missouri River channel is to the north. Elevation
of the wet! pad area is about 1850 feet.

FILES SEARCH: The files of the North Dakota State Historical Society
indicate that no previous surveys or cultural resources are known for
the project area. Previous surveys in adjacent and nearby areas include
well pad and access road surveys by Greer, a pipeline survey by Powers
Elevation, and seismograph line studies by the Corps of Engineers; all
previous studies have provided negative results. No subsurface monitor-
ing of construction to provide subsurface information has been reported
in any surrounding or nearby areas.

FIELD WORK: During the intensive cultural resource survey on 3/30/86 by

John and Mavis Greer, the 5 acres surrounding the well pad were surveyed

with multiple transects with an average spacing of 70 feet. Ground
visibility was fair to poor, due to mostly dense stubble and grass cover.
The well location was staked.

CULTURAL RESOURCES: No cultural resources have been reported from the

area, and none were found during the present inspection. There were no
surface indications of buried cultural deposits within the project area.
Two small shovel tests dug to 1.5 feet deep within the well pad planned
construction area also yielded negative results.

RECOMMENDATIONS: It appears that mo cultural resources will be affected

by the proposed project, and no further work is recommended. If subsur-
face cultural materials are found during construction, the head of the
federal permitting agency should be notified immediately. These recom-
mendations are subject to the approval of the permitting agency.

ATTACHMENTS: Project map (USGS quad).

COLLECTIONS: None.

ND Permit No. 11920

Gentlemen:

The permitted Basie Corps of Engineers #31-10 location is under two feet of
water due to the Missouri River flooding. We estimate a minimum delay of one
month before construction of the drill pad can begin. Since the frost should
no longer be a factor by that time, we believe a conventional drill pad would
be acceptable, therefore, permission 1s requested to deviate from the
requirement to cover the pad with plastic and build the location up with dirt
acquired from a private source.

The Multi-Point Surface Use and Operation Plan should be amended as follows:

y. Location of Existing and/or Proposed Facilities

B. Exhibits 3 and 4 show the surveyed location and the anticipated cut
and fill. These show that after removing six to eight inches of top
soil, the entire cut will be above 1850 feet. There should be
sufficient dirt available from the drill pit and fill to level the
location. All top soil and dirt removed during construction of the
reserve pits will be placed in separate piles. Both piles will be
kept as free as possible from contamination.

Cc. Construction will be to strip the top soil and level the drilling
pad. The battery evsssess

MULTI-POINT SURFACE USE AND OPERATIONS PLAN

For access roads in relation to county roads, see Exhibit 1.1 with
the access of U.S. 85 highlighted in pink. This map shows all
county roads within a three mile radius.

Exhibit 1.2 shows a detailed map of the existing roads. The first
two miles of access off U.S. 85, marked in green, is a high quality
gravel road. The following 460', marked in pink, is an existing
gravel road with access onto the location.

Roads within a one-mile radius are shown on Exhibit 1.1.

Existing roads will be maintained as necessary to allow access
during drilling and completion operations.

Planned Access Roads

Referencing Exhibit 1.e¢ and the through segments of road:

A.

Prior to drilling, the existing roads will be upgraded as follows:

(1) Gravel Road (Exhibit 1.2, green) This segment of road is in
good condition. Basic Earth Science Systems, Ine. has recently
upgraded this road in conjunction with other activity in this
area and will continue to keep this road maintained.

(2) Gravel Road {Exhibit 1.2, pink) This existing gravel road will
require no improvement and will only require that the accesses
to the location be built.

If the well is completed as a dry hole, the access will be
reclaimed along with the rest of the location.

If the well is completed as a producer, the lease road will be
upgraded as required and gravel added as needed.

The maximum grade will be less than six percent, however, this may
vary as topographical conditions vary.

No turnouts are planned.
No culverts are planned.
Native surfacing material from construction of access road will he
sufficient for drilling. No outside construction materials are
anticipated, if additional material is needed, then it will be
acquired from a private source and it will be free of noxious weeds.

No gates, cattleguards or fence cuts will be necessary.

No road will be built. The location will be accessed from the

-existing gravel road.

SUMMARY OF PROJECT

Basic Earth Science Systems, Inc. is submitting the following application to
obtain permission from the Corps of Engineers to drill a 13,600 foot Red River
test with the above-referenced name and surface location. The location has
been carefully chosen to balance the concerns of Basic Earth Science Systems,
Ine., the Corps of Engineers, and surface lessee (North Dakota Game and Fish).
From this surface location Basic Earth Science Systems, Ine. will
directionally drill to a legal bottom hole location of 660' FNL and 2140' FEL
_ of Section 10, T153N, R101W. All of the oil and gas minerals in this area are
privately owned. Basic Earth Science Systems, Inc. understands that this
location is within the 100-year flood plain. Any facilities and equipment
“hich can be damaged by floodwater and which cannot be readily moved if a
flood is imminent will be placed at a location above, or adequately protected
by diking to 1858", the 100-year flood water surface elevation at this
location plus a minimum of three feet of freeboard to protect against wind-
wave runup. Due to lease constraints this well must be drilling by February
1, 1986, and, therefore, your expeditious processing of this application is
requested.

Location of Existing and/or Proposed Facilities

A.

Basic Earth Science Systems, Inc. has production facilities on their
Rosebud #22-11 location approximately 4050 ft. to the southwest.
These consist of standard producing equipment for a Red River well.
The Basic Game & Fish #34-3 is being completed in the SWiSWs Section
2, Township 153 North, Range 101 West, and equipment will be
installed for Mission Canyon production. Basic Earth Science
Systems, Inc. has no other facilities in the area.

Exhibits 3 and 4 show the surveyed location and the anticipated cut
and fill. Complying with the Corps of Engineers’ requirement because
of the frozen condition of the land, the wellsite will have the snow
and vegetation bladed off down to the ground surface, a plastic
liner laid on top and dirt added to level the location. The dirt
Will be taken from the construction of the pit.

New facilities contemplated in the event of production are shown on
Exhibit 6.

(1) Proposed tank battery and production equipment are as shown on
Exhibit 6 and are to be located adjacent to the existing road
as shown on Exhibit 6. Said equipment will be bermed as per
the Army Corps of Engineers’ requirement.

{2} Dimension of the facilities are shown on Exhibit 6.

(3) Construction will be to strip the topsoil, level drilling pad.
The battery site and treater pits will be constructed with soil
materials native to the site. The additional material needed on
site will be acquired from a private source and will contain no
noxious weeds. Construction methods will be employed to assume
that no drainage flows are impounded to prevent the loss of any
hydrocarbon from the site. This is to be done in a manner to
facilitate rapid recovery and clean up. (See Exhibit 6).

MULTI-POINT SURFACE USE AND OPERATIONS PLAN

(4) Protective measures to protect wildlife and livestock will be

taken as follows: the weights on the pumping unit will be
enclosed and the production pit will be fenced.

Upon completion of well, areas required for continued use will be
graded to provide drainage and minimize erosion. Those areas
unnecessary for use will be graded to blend with the surrounding
topography. Top-soil will be replaced on those areas and seeded
with Brome grass or other mixture as required by the Corps of
Engineers and the North Dakota Game and Fish Department.

Location and Type of Water Supply

A.

C.

Fresh water for spudding and drilling the first 6500 feet will be
trucked to location over the roads shown on Exhibit 1.2. Salt water
for the salt-saturated mud system will be trucked from Williston.

Salt and fresh water will be trucked to location over the roads
marked on Exhibit 1.2.

No water well is to be drilled on this lease.

Source of Construction Materials

A.

Exhibit 5 shows the layout of the planned pad for drilling purposes,
This layout represents the maximum area to be disturbed. Ifa
smaller drilling rig is available, the actual size of the location
will be reduced to minimize the area disturbed. Prior to leveling
off the drillsite pad, the brush covering location will be scraped
into a pile on the southeast corner of the location. A sheet of
plastic will be laid over the wellsite. Dirt removed from the pit
will be distributed on the plastic. The site will then be leveled
and laid out as shown on Exhibit 5. If the well is productive, the
drillsite will be reclaimed and an area sufficient for the wellhead
and a completion rig will be left at the proposed drillsite. The
production equipment will then be installed as shown in Exhibit 6.
Said production equipment and wellhead will be diked as required by
the Corps of Engineers. Gravel will then be placed on the
production pad. Construction materials will consist of soil
encountered within the boundaries of the proposed site. Gravel will
be used, as needed. The entire producing facility will be fenced
with a two strand barbless wire fence.

The planned site and access roads are outleased to the North Dakota
Game and Fish Department.

MULTI-POINT SURFACE USE AND OPERATIONS PLAN

Cc. All gravel (containing no noxious weeds) will be obtained frop
private land in quantities necessary for the access surfacing and
tank base material on the battery site.

Methods for Handling Waste Disposal

This well is being drilled to a depth of 6500 feet with fresh water.
From that depth on salt water will be used. All cuttings and salt
saturated material generated will be hauled off location during and after
completion of the well. Upon the completion of drilling operations, all
waste materials including, but not limited to drill cuttings, drilling
fluids, and burned and unburned trash, shall be completely removed from
Government land as directed by the Project Manager, Garrison Project. No
waste material shall be buried on site.

A. All drill cuttings will be stored on site ina 20 mil plastic lined
pit during drilling and hauled off site prior to reclamation.

B. All fresh water drilling fluids will be removed from site or allowed
to evaporate from the reserve pit.

C. At. 6500 feet we will be switching over to a brine system. All
liquid and solid waste that is produced will be hauled from the
site, either during or immediately after drilling is completed. All
waste stored on location during drilling activities will be stored
in steel containers or in an earthern dike lined with 20 mil plastic
liner. ~

D. No substantial amount of produced water is expected while drilling.
The amount of hydrocarbon that may be produced while testing will be
stored in a tank. The small amount of loss will be retained in the
reserve pit. Previous to clean-up operations the hydrocarbon
materials will be skimmed or removed as the situation would dictate.

E. Sanitary facilities will consist of chemical toilets. Waste
will be contained and hauled from the site immediately following the
drilling operations.

F. Garbage and nonflammable waste are to be contained in the trash pit.
Flammable waste is to be contained in the burn pit. The flammable
trash is to be burned periodically. The trash and/or burn pit will
be totally enclosed with small mesh wire to prevent wind scattering
and wildlife entry. The pit will be fenced and flagged to prevent
entry of livestock. All non-flammable trash will be hauled from
site prior to reclamation.

10.

_MULTI-POINT SURFACE USE AND OPERATIONS PLAN

All trash, garbage, etc. is to be gathered and burned or hauled from
the site at the end of drilling operations. Reserve and mud pits
will be trenched as needed and allowed to dry after drilling is
completed and then adequately filled and leveled. All garbage and
pits will be filled as soon as the rig leaves the location.

Ancillary Facilities

There are no airstrips, camps or other facilities planned during the
drilling of the proposed well.

Well Site Layout

A.

C.

See Exhibit 5 for a cross section of the drill pad with cut and
fills. Exhibit 5 shows that the location is relatively flat and
there will be approximately a three foot cut and one foot of fill on
the drill pad.

Rig layout is shown on Exhibit 7. No permanent living facilities
are planned. However, during drilling operations, three trailers
will be on location.

Location of mud &anks; reserve, burn and trash pits; pipe racks;
and soil material stockpiles are shown on Exhibits 6 and 7.

Plans for Restoration of Surface

A.

If well is completed as dry hole.

(1) The reserve pit will be fenced until dry and all drill cuttings
and salt saturated water material from the pits will be hauled,
pits backfilled, leveled, and contoured. The brush pile will
be burned and reincorporated with the top soil. The top soil
will be redistributed and seeded.

(2) If aceess road is not needed, it will be leveled, top soiled,
and reseeded.

(3) If there is oil in the pit, it will be removed immediately
after drilling.

(4) Rehabilitation operations will begin immediately after the
drilling rig is removed. The trash and/or burn pits will be
covered. Produced fluids will be removed or flagged overhead
and fenced immediately. Reseeding and revegetation operations
shall be accomplished in accordance with the instructions, and
to the satisfaction, of the Project Manager, Garrison Project.
The entire reclamation process will be completed after the
spring thaw of 1986.

11.

B.

MULTI-POINT SURFACE USE AND OPERATIONS PLAN
If the well is completed as a producer.

(1) The pit will be trenched and backfilled as soon as possible and
all excess liquids will be hauled off site.

(2) The road will be upgraded as discussed in Section 2 and the
production pad will be reduced in areal extent as discussed in
Section §.A. The area to be returned to the Game and Fish will
be reclaimed as soon as feasible after the well is completed.
The reclamation will consist of returning the ground to
original contours and redistributing the top soil and seeding
with Brome grass or other seed mixtures as required by the Game
and Fish. The excess top soil pile will be seeded to prevent
erosion.

Other Information

Topography: The location borders the Missouri River floodplain.

The surface at the drillsite and on the access road is outleased to
the North Dakota Game and Fish Department. The surface settlement
with the Game and Fish is attached as Exhibit 12.

The nearest occupied dwelling is greater than a mile south of the
site.

Tne nearest source for water is approximately 1/4 mile east of the
location.

An archeological survey is being conducted and will be submitted
under separate cover for inelusion in this application as Exhibit 8.

Drilling is planned for February 1, 1986. It is anticipated that
casing point will be reached within 55 days after commencement of
drilling.

The surface hole and first 3000' will be drilled with fresh water, using
gel pills as needed to keep hole clean. The saturation of the mud will
then be allowed to increase to saturated before drilling the Pine Salt at
6822'. The system will be kept salt saturated to TD.

Testing, Logging and Coring Programs (Proposed, depending shows)

A. Drill Stem Tests will be made in any formation indicating commercial
production.

B. Logs run will be an Integrated Sonic Log from 2000' to total depth;
a Dual Induction Log from surface to total depth; and a FDC/CNL Log
from approximately 6000' to total depth.

c. A two man mud logging unit will be on location from §500' to TD.

D. No cores are anticipated.
E. We do not anticipate using fracture treatment.
F. Directional surveys will be taken every 500' from surface to TD and

the connection above any anticipated salts and the connection below
the Pine and Charles salts.

Anticipated Abnormal Pressures or Temperatures Expected

No abnormal pressures or temperatures have been noted or reported in
wells drilled in the area at the depths anticipated in the well. Bottom
hole temperature should be approximately 280°F at TD, but not extreme.

Traces of hydrogen sulfide may be encountered from g000' to TD. Adequate
precautions will be taken and equipment installed. An H5S safety
supervisor will be used to train the crews in proper use of the safety
equipment and in H5S awareness. He will also be on location during
testing of potential H55 bearing formations.
