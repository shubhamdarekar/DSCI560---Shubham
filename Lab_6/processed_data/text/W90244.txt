To Whom It May Concern:

NDIC records indicate that injection into the above saltwater disposal weil is through an injection pipeline
between a pump and the well head which are not located on the same site. The NDIC requires that all
offsite high pressure injection pipelines for saltwater disposal wells be tested for mechanical integrity on an
annual basis. The required pipeline pressure test procedure is as follows:

1) Injection pipeline pressure test must be witnessed by an NDIC Field Inspector. Contact the
appropriate NDIC Field Inspector to schedule the test.

2) Pressure line to 100 psi above maximum injection pressure or 100 psi over the maximum
operating pressure of the line whichever is greater. The duration of the pressure test must
be at least 30 minutes. Be sure to note the starting and ending pressures and the pressure at 5
minute intervals for the duration of the test.

3) Depending on the results as determined by the NDIC:

a. It may be necessary to shut in the pressurized line for 24 hours to stabilize temperature
of test fluid and allow any air or gases to accumulate in order to be purged.

b. Following the 24 hour shut-in period, re-pressurize line and document the amount of
fluid needed to return pressure to 100 psi above maximum injection pressure.

c. Pressure test line for 30 minutes.

4) Submit to the NDIC a Form 4 Sundry Notice detailing the test results (e.g. date of test, starting
and ending pressures and pressure at 5 minute intervals, amount of fluid, etc.). The Sundry
Notice should also include details on the line that was tested (e.g. length of line, installation
date, type of pipe, type of fittings, pressure rating of pipe and fittings, etc.).

If you have any questions, do not hesitate to contact me.

Sincerely,

Ashleigh Day

RE: Saltwater Disposal Well Reporting and Monitoring Requirements
Dear Saltwater Disposal Operator:

This letter is to outline and clarify the Commission’s requirements for monthly reporting and
monitoring of saltwater disposal wells which are outlined under North Dakota Administrative
Code (NDAC) Section 43-02-05-12, and the type of wastes that can be injected pursuant to the
EPA guidelines for Exempt and Non-Exempt Oil and Gas Exploration and Production Wastes.

All injection into a saltwater disposal well must be measured, either through a meter or by an
approved method. Accurate gauges must be placed on the tubing and tubing-casing annulus of the
well for pressure monitoring. Any noncompliance with regulations or permit conditions must be
reported to the Commission orally within 24 hours followed by a written explanation within 5
days.

Monthly reporting of the following information is required to be submitted for a saltwater
disposal well on a Saltwater Disposal Report (Form 16):

1. Beginning and end of month meter readings.

2. Total barrels injected for the month.

3. Average daily operating injection pressure (this means a typical pressure observed while
the well is injecting, not a mathematical average).

4. Sources of received fluid (these sources need to be listed by well or facility name and
number, NDIC well or facility file number, and the location of each source by
quarter-quarter, section, township, and range).

5. Amount of fluid received from each source.

6. Nature of the received fluid (i.e. produced water, pit water, etc.).

7. Transportation method used to transport the injection fluid to the disposal well site (i.e.

pipeline or truck).

Saltwater Disposal Reports (Form 16) are due on or before the fifth day of the second month
succeeding the month in which the well is capable of disposal (i.e. January report due March 5th).

Pursuant to NDAC Section 43-02-05-13.1, all records from which to make and substantiate
required reports shall be kept for a period of not less than six years.

The NDIC abides by the Environmental Protection Agency guidelines for Exempt and
Non-Exempt Oil and Gas Exploration and Production Wastes to determine what wastes can be
accepted for disposal from oil and gas exploration and production operations. Attached is an
example list of exempt and non-exempt oil and gas exploration and production wastes along with a
flow chart for determining the status of a waste.

The operator is only authorized to inject Class II fluids into a saltwater disposal well. Class
II fluids are generally defined as follows:

l.
2.
3.

nM

seen

Produced water from oil and gas production.

Waste fluids from actual drilling operations.

Used workover, completion, and stimulation fluids recovered from production, injection,
and exploratory wells.

Waste fluids from circulation during well cementing.

Pigging fluids from cleaning of collection and injection lines within the field.

Enhanced recovery waters including fresh water makeup and other waters containing
chemicals for the purpose of enhanced recovery.

Gases used for enhanced recovery/pressure maintenance of production reservoirs.

Brine reject from water softeners associated with enhanced recovery.

Waste oil and fluids from clean up within the oil field.

0. Waste water from gas plants which are an integral part of production operations unless

those waters are classified as hazardous waste at the time of injection.

The following fluids are non-exempt fluids and are not authorized to be injected into a Class

II saltwater disposal well:
1. Unused fracturing fluids or acids.
2. Vacuum truck and drum rinsate from trucks and drums containing non-exempt waste.
3. Refined gasoline or diesel fuels.
4. Used equipment lubricating oils.
5. Refinery wastes.
6. Radioactive tracer wastes.

Synopsis

Oasis Petroleum - Buck Shot SWD 5300 31-31H [NW SW Sec. 31, T153N-R100W] is located approximately 13 miles
south of Williston, North Dakota situated in the Indian hills prospect area. Buck Shot SWD 5300 31-31H is a
proposed injection well with a single extended late ral leg trending 14.2 degrees from the NW SW corner of section
31 to the SW NW corner of section 31. The intended targeted reservoir is the upper zone of the Inyan Kara
formation of the Dakota.

Control Wells

Throughout the course of drilling the Buck Shot SWD 5300 31-31H well one primary offset well provided valuable
data in regards to formation tops, lithology and geosteering decisions. There were five offset wells total, but the
Lewis Federal 5300 was the only offset used due to the extensive similarities with the Buck Shot SWD 5300 31-31H
well. The estimated prognosis formation tops were provided by Oasis Petroleum prospect geologists. Correlating
this data with this offset well provided a generalized structure map for the Buck Shot well. This data was used to
further estimate the distance to the target while landing the curve (See Table 1)

The primary control well, the Lewis Federal 5300 [NW SW Sec. 31 T153N R100W] was congruently used to
establish structural relationship to the northeast the Lewis well is operated by Oasis Petroleum North America LLC
and was completed in the Dakota formation. The neutron-density/gamma ray log was used to correlate the
drilling of the Buck Shot SWD 5300 31-31H.

RPM Geologic provided wellsite geologic supervision for Buck Shot SWD 5300 31-31H with a team of geologic
consultants. Sample logging and geo-steering services were conducted by a 2 person geology team throughout the
vertical and lateral hole. Lagged lithology samples were collected by rig personnel at 30’ intervals as directed by
the wellsite geologist. Additional samples were collected at intervals of greater interest.

Wet and dry sample analysis was conducted under a 10x-75x zoom digital stereoscope. Comprehensive lit hology
descriptions were recorded on the vertical, horizontal logs and as an appendix to this report. Chemical testing of
samples using 10% HCI solution aided in accurately deducing mineral composition. Additionally one set of dried,
cleaned samples were retained for the North Dakota Industrial Commission.

RPM geologists used lithology, gamma ray, rates of penetration, and natural formation deflections to advise
directional and company personnel on TVD targets and geosteering decisions with the goal of maintaining a
predetermined drilling interval with the target formation. Consultation with Oasis Petroleum Operations
geologists provided structural maps, cross sectional interpretations and estimated formation tops prognosis.

Vertical Operations

Overview

The Buck Shot SWD 5300 31-31H was spud by Precision 565 on June 18th, 2013 with a 13 1/2” surface hole drilled
to 2,135’. 95/8” J-55 LTC 36# surface casing was set and cemented to a total depth of 2,135’ and drilling resumed
with BHA #2 (Bottom hole assembly) consisting of an 8 %” Smith MDSIZ616. After setting surface casing the fresh
water mud was displaced with diesel invert oil base d mud for the remainder of the vertical and curve. A total
depth of 6,035’ was reached in the vertical, and at this point a cement plug was pumped to set up for the drilling of
the 70 degree tangent. After pumping cement the well took on water below the forth sand bed, and due to this
new cement plug was set to a depth of 5,255’ MD

RPM Geologists began logging of the Buck Shot SWD 5300 31-31H well in the Pierre formation per client
specifications.

Lithology

Logging of the Pierre Shale began at 4,000’ MD.

The Pierre Shale [Montana Group] was logged from 4,000’ MD / 4,000’ TVD. Samples descriptions are as follows
(Figure 1);

SHALE: light to medium gray, occasional orange, soft to friable, sub-blocky to blocky, earthy texture, no
visible porosity

SHALE: medium to dark gray, soft to friable, sub-blocky to blocky, earthy texture, no visible porosity

Second Dakota Sand Top; an adjustment from the initial TVD of the top of the Third Dakota Sand Top was made
based on the gamma ray interpretation. No other adjustments were made and the curve was successfully landed
at a measured depth of 6,202’.

Lithology

The Greenhorn [Colorado Group] is the first “marker bed” used to estimate the isopach depth to the tar get zone.
Drilled at 4,644’ MD / 4,644’ TVD (-2,462’ MSL) was 5’ low to the prognosis. Sample descriptions from the
Greenhorn are as follows (Figure 2);

SHALE: medium to dark gray, soft to friable, sub-blocky to blocky, micaceous, calcareous, earthy texture,

Directional Operations

Directional services were provided by RPM Consulting while MWD services were provided Ryan energy. RPM
Geologists worked closely and efficiently with dire ctional and MWD Services to effectively maintain the wellbore
within the target zone.

Curve

Drilling of the curve began on the 27"" June 2013 with BHA #3 consisting of an 8.75” Smith XR+. The curve was
completed to a depth of 6,207’ MD in 25 hours, with an average rate of penetration of 38.08 ft. /hr. Intermediate
casing (7” 26# L-80 LTC) was successfully set to a total depth of 2,135’ and cemented back to surface. 4.5” PVC-
lined tubing packer set was then set to a depth of 6,202’ MD and cemented back.

Initially target landing depths were incorporated from the geologic prognosis formulated previous to drilling
operations. Once the curve commenced amendments to the landing target and the proposed top of the Forth
Dakota Sand were made based on gamma ray interpretations of “marker beds”. The first of these adjustm ents
was made at the Greenhorn, no change here was necessitated. The second consistent “marker bed” was the

The First Dakota Sand Top [Dakota Group] was drilled at 5,588’ MD / 5,522’ TVD (-3,340 MSL) 4’ high to the
prognosis depth. Samples are described as follows (Figure 4);

Geosteering

The target zone was initially defined only as the 10’ below the Forth Dakota Sand Top, however a TD of 6,555’ MD,
5,900’ TVD was agreed on. A proposed tangent of 60 to 70 degrees was plotted initially when drilling out of the
surface casing shoe. This dip was amended as repetitious markers were observed while drilling the lat eral.

Lithology Report

Logging of the Buck Shot SWD 5300 31-31H well by RPM Geologic geologists Tyson Zentz and Adam Graves
commenced on June 18th, 2013. Rig crews began catching samples at 30’ intervals at a depth of 4,000’ in
the Pierre formation through the forth sand bench of the Dakota formation. Samples were examined using a

digital stereoscope.

HCL was used to aid in determining lithology. Quantifiers in the descriptions are as

follows in order of increasing magnitude; trace, rare, occasional, common and abundant.

Buck Shot SWD 5300 31-31

Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC
Section 31, T153N R100W

McKenzie County, North Dakota

Application for Fluid Injection
PROPOSED INJECTION PROGRAM

The Buck Shot SWD 5300 31-31 well will be used to inject produced water from wells in the Indian Hills
area - Oasis Bakken and Three Forks wells already on production, in the process of completion, and those
soon to be drilled in the four township area of 152-153N and 100-101 W into the Dakota formation.
Injection depths will be determined after the well is drilled and logged.

The Buck Shot SWD will utilize the existing tanks and pump facilities of the Oasis-operated BWL SWD
5201 11-3. The injection pump will send water to both the BWL SWD and Buck Shot SWD. There will
be a pressure transducer at the outlet of the pump that limits the maximum pressure of the discharge to the
permitted pressure. This pressure transducer will communicate to the VFD that controls the pump to
maximize the efficiency of the pump as well as shut it off at the max allowable pressure. There will be 2
flow meters after the tee in the discharge line, one for the BWL SWD and the other for the Buck Shot
SWD.

The flowline to the Buck Shot wellhead will tap into the existing 6 inch flexsteel pipe that is currently in
operation for the BWL SWD. This flowline is rated for 2250 psi, approximately 700 psi above the
maximum allowable pressure for the Buck Shot SWD. The lease operator will be on location on a daily
basis to monitor both SWD locations and the flowline that feeds both the BWL SWD and Buck Shot
SWD.

The wellhead and horizontal lateral of the Oasis-operated Lewis Federal 5300 31-31H well is within the
Y, mile area of review but no corrective action is required as the lateral of the Lewis Federal 5300 31-31H
is completed within the Bakken Formation which is separated from the Dakota Group by the Swift
confining layer and several thousand feet of other impermeable shales.

The horizontal lateral of the Oasis-operated Gramma Federal 5300 41-31T well is within the % mile area
of review but no corrective action is required as this lateral was drilled within the Bakken Formation
which is separated from the Dakota Group by the Swift confining layer and several thousand feet of other
impermeable shales. The vertical portion of the Gramma Federal 5300 41-31T lies outside of the % mile
AOR for the Buck Shot SWD.

The proposed Buck Shot SWD is needed to provide a more local disposal facility in the area to reduce
costs and ease the burden on regional disposal wells, it will supplement the existing BWL SWD. The
anticipated initial injection rate of the well will be 5,000 bwpd at 1,000 psig pressure. However, this rate
may increase with additional drilling in the area, subject to the maximum pressure ceiling.

DETAILS OF WORK
Oasis Petroleum North America LLC respectfully requests its approved APD to drill the Buck Shot SWD 5300 31-31 be
revised to allow for a horizontal completion.

No additional landowners be impacted by this change.

The horizontal lateral of the Oasis-operated Gramma Federal 5300 41-31T well is within the % mile area of review but
no corrective action is required as this lateral was drilled within the Bakken Formation

which is separated from the Dakota Group by the Swift confining layer and several thousand feet of other
impermeable shales. The vertical portion of the Gramma Federal 5300 41-31T lies outside of the % mile

AOR for the Buck Shot SWD.

Oasis Petroleum North America LLC requests permission for suspension of drilling for up to ‘90 days for the
referenced well under NDAC 43-02-03-55. Oasis Petroleum North America LLC intends to drill the surface hole with
freshwater based drilling mud and set surface casing with a small drilling rig and move off within 3 to 5 days. The
casing will be set at a depth pre-approved by the NDIC per the Application for Permit to Drill NDAC 43-02-03-21. No
saltwater will be used In the drilling and cementing operations of the surface casing. Once the surface casing is

Exhibit 1 — Lithologic Description

Buck Shot SWD 5300 31-31

Salt Water Disposal Well
McKenzie County, North Dakota
31-153N-100W

Cretaceous Dakota within the Inyan Kara is 450’ thick in this area. The section
consists of a sequence of alternating sand, silt and shale. Individual sand layers
can be up to 50’ thick and display a porosity of 20-25%, In the Lindvig 3-14 this
section is quite laminated and shows a higher sand percentage toward the base of
the section. Sands are generally poorly sorted and vary from fine to coarse
grained.

The Skull Creek/Newcastle is predominantly medium gray shale and is
interbedded with thin layers of siltstone and sandy siltstone. It is about 250’ in
the Lindvig 3-14 well.

The Swift Shale consists of gray shales in the upper portion. These shales
become interbedded with limestones and sandy limestones lower in the
section. It is 460’ in the Lindvig 3-14.

Exhibit 3 — Proposed Injection Program

June 13, 2012

Buck Shot SWD 5300 31-31

Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC
Section 31, T153N R100W

McKenzie County, North Dakota

Application for Fluid Injection
PROPOSED INJECTION PROGRAM

The Buck Shot SWD 5300 31-31 well will be used to inject produced water from wells in the Indian Hills
area - Oasis Bakken and Three Forks wells already on production, in the process of completion, and those
soon to be drilled in the four township area of 152-153N and 100-101 W into the Dakota formation.
Injection depths will be determined after the well is drilled and logged.

The Buck Shot SWD will utilize the existing tanks and pump facilities of the Oasis-operated BWL SWD
5201 11-3. The injection pump will send water to both the BWL SWD and Buck Shot SWD. There will
be a pressure transducer at the outlet of the pump that limits the maximum pressure of the discharge to the
permitted pressure. This pressure transducer will communicate to the VFD that controls the pump to
maximize the efficiency of the pump as well as shut it off at the max allowable pressure. There will be 2
flow meters after the tee in the discharge line, one for the BWL SWD and the other for the Buck Shot
SWD.

The flowline to the Buck Shot wellhead will tap into the existing 6 inch flexsteel pipe that is currently in
operation for the BWL SWD. This flowline is rated for 2250 psi, approximately 700 psi above the
maximum allowable pressure for the Buck Shot SWD. The lease operator will be on Jocation on a daily
basis to monitor both SWD locations and the flowline that feeds both the BWL SWD and Buck Shot
SWD.

The wellhead and horizontal lateral of the Oasis-operated Lewis Federal 5300 31-31H well is within the
“a mile area of review but no corrective action is required as the lateral of the Lewis Federal 5300 31-31H
is completed within the Bakken Formation which is separated from the Dakota Group by the Swift
confining layer and several thousand feet of other impermeable shales.

The proposed Buck Shot SWD is needed to provide a more local disposal facility in the area to reduce
costs and ease the burden on regional disposal wells, it will supplement the existing BWL SWD. The
anticipated initial injection rate of the well will be 5,000 bwpd at 1,000 psig pressure. However, this rate
may increase with additional drilling in the area, subject to the maximum pressure ceiling.
