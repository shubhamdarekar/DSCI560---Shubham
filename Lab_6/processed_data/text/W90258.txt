Saltwater Disposal Well Reporting and Monitoring Requirements
Page 2 of 2

The NDIC abides by the Environmental Protection Agency guidelines for Exempt and
Non-Exempt Oil and Gas Exploration and Production Wastes to determine what wastes can be
accepted for disposal from oil and gas exploration and production operations. Attached is an
example list of exempt and non-exempt oil and gas exploration and production wastes along with a
flow chart for determining the status of a waste.

The operator is only authorized to inject Class II fluids into a saltwater disposal well. Class
II fluids are generally defined as follows:

1.

Produced water from oil and gas production.

2. Waste fluids from actual drilling operations.

3.

+

nm

= won

Used workover, completion, and stimulation fluids recovered from production, injection,
and exploratory wells.

Waste fluids from circulation during well cementing.

Pigging fluids from cleaning of collection and injection lines within the field.

Enhanced recovery waters including fresh water makeup and other waters containing
chemicals for the purpose of enhanced recovery.

Gases used for enhanced recovery/pressure maintenance of production reservoirs.

Brine reject from water softeners associated with enhanced recovery.

Waste oil and fluids from clean up within the oil field.

. Waste water from gas plants which are an integral part of production operations unless

those waters are classified as hazardous waste at the time of injection.

The following fluids are non-exempt fluids and are not authorized to be injected into a Class
II saltwater disposal well:

NAY WNS

Unused fracturing fluids or acids.

Vacuum truck and drum rinsate from trucks and drums containing non-exempt waste.
Refined gasoline or diesel fuels.

Used equipment lubricating oils.

Refinery wastes.

Radioactive tracer wastes.

Car wash wastes.

Please distribute this letter and the attachment to the appropriate personnel responsible for
reporting on and monitoring each saltwater disposal well your company operates. If you have any
questions, do not hesitate to contact me.

Sincerely,

Ashleigh Day
Underground Injection Supervisor

RE: Saltwater Disposal Well Reporting and Monitoring Requirements
Dear Saltwater Disposal Operator:

This letter is to outline and clarify the Commission’s requirements for monthly reporting and
monitoring of saltwater disposal wells which are outlined under North Dakota Administrative
Code (NDAC) Section 43-02-05-12, and the type of wastes that can be injected pursuant to the
EPA guidelines for Exempt and Non-Exempt Oil and Gas Exploration and Production Wastes.

All injection into a saltwater disposal well must be measured, either through a meter or by an
approved method. Accurate gauges must be placed on the tubing and tubing-casing annulus of the
well for pressure monitoring. Any noncompliance with regulations or permit conditions must be
reported to the Commission orally within 24 hours followed by a written explanation within 5
days.

Monthly reporting of the following information is required to be submitted for a saltwater
disposal well on a Saltwater Disposal Report (Form 16):

Beginning and end of month meter readings.

Total barrels injected for the month.

Average daily operating injection pressure (this means a typical pressure observed while
the well is injecting, not a mathematical average).

4. Sources of received fluid (these sources need to be listed by well or facility name and
number, NDIC well or facility file number, and the location of each source by
quarter-quarter, section, township, and range).

Amount of fluid received from each source.

Nature of the received fluid (i.e. produced water, pit water, etc.).

7. Transportation method used to transport the injection fluid to the disposal well site (i.e.
pipeline or truck).

wo Ne

By.

Saltwater Disposal Reports (Form 16) are due on or before the fifth day of the second month
succeeding the month in which the well is capable of disposal (i.e. January report due March 5th).

Pursuant to NDAC Section 43-02-05-13.1, all records from which to make and substantiate
required reports shall be kept for a period of not less than six years.

Statement of corrective action required for wells within the % mile area of review

There are no existing wells within % mile of the proposed Atlanta #1 SWD. However, all fourteen
producing wells drilled on the Atlanta pad will have identical cementing programs for their 7”
intermediate casing. The cement will be pumped to the surface, and will provide complete coverage
across the proposed Dakota injection interval.

Atlanta #1 SWD
Sec 6-T153N-R101W

Description of the proposed injection program

Continental Resources proposes to drill and complete the Atlanta #1 SWD in the Dakota formation
(5450’ — 5900’) in Sec 6-T153N-R101W of Williams County, ND. This SWD well will service the fourteen
wells that will be drilled on the pad. Seven of the wells will be completed in the Bakken and seven of the

wells will be completed in the Three Forks.

The produced water will be cycled through 6 - 750 bbl tanks and filtered prior to being injected. The
Atlanta #1 SWD will receive the produced water from a buried steel line connected to the disposal
pumps. The facility will be equipped with emergency shutdown equipment and an automated callout

system.

Subject: RE: Atlanta #1 SWD Information
Stephen,

In regards to 1 below, we did send notice to more than we were supposed to. What we did was actually
send out notifications to all landowners within % mile of the entire pad and not just the location of the
SWD well. Because of this, we notified close to % mile out from the SWD instead of the required % mile
radius. | talked with our land operations coordinator Chad Newby and he stated that Wilbert & irene
Koch were located outside of the % mile radius that we were required to notify but were located within
a % mile of the outside boundary of the entire Atlanta pad.

Please let me know if you need a map showing where they are located or if this email will suffice. Sorry
if our over-notification caused any headaches.

We are working on getting an updated diagram for the berm and should have it to you early next week.

Thanks,

Bob Sandbo
