Saltwater Disposal Well Reporting and Monitoring Requirements
Page 2 of 2

The NDIC abides by the Environmental Protection Agency guidelines for Exempt and
Non-Exempt Oil and Gas Exploration and Production Wastes to determine what wastes can be
accepted for disposal from oil and gas exploration and production operations. Attached is an
example list of exempt and non-exempt oil and gas exploration and production wastes along with a
flow chart for determining the status of a waste.

The operator is only authorized to inject Class II fluids into a saltwater disposal well. Class
II fluids are generally defined as follows:

1.

Produced water from oil and gas production.

2. Waste fluids from actual drilling operations.

3.

au

SON

Used workover, completion, and stimulation fluids recovered from production, injection,
and exploratory wells.

Waste fluids from circulation during well cementing.

Pigging fluids from cleaning of collection and injection lines within the field.

Enhanced recovery waters including fresh water makeup and other waters containing
chemicals for the purpose of enhanced recovery.

Gases used for enhanced recovery/pressure maintenance of production reservoirs.

Brine reject from water softeners associated with enhanced recovery.

Waste oil and fluids from clean up within the oil field.

0. Waste water from gas plants which are an integral part of production operations unless

those waters are classified as hazardous waste at the time of injection.

The following fluids are non-exempt fluids and are not authorized to be injected into a Class
II saltwater disposal well:

NAYMPYN SD

Unused fracturing fluids or acids.

Vacuum truck and drum rinsate from trucks and drums containing non-exempt waste.
Refined gasoline or diesel fuels.

Used equipment lubricating oils.

Refinery wastes.

Radioactive tracer wastes.

Car wash wastes.

Please distribute this letter and the attachment to the appropriate personnel responsible for
reporting on and monitoring each saltwater disposal well your company operates. If you have any
questions, do not hesitate to contact me.

Sincerely,

Ashleigh Day
Underground Injection Supervisor

RE: Saltwater Disposal Well Reporting and Monitoring Requirements
Dear Saltwater Disposal Operator:

This letter is to outline and clarify the Commission’s requirements for monthly reporting and
monitoring of saltwater disposal wells which are outlined under North Dakota Administrative
Code (NDAC) Section 43-02-05-12, and the type of wastes that can be injected pursuant to the
EPA guidelines for Exempt and Non-Exempt Oil and Gas Exploration and Production Wastes.

All injection into a saltwater disposal well must be measured, either through a meter or by an
approved method. Accurate gauges must be placed on the tubing and tubing-casing annulus of the
well for pressure monitoring. Any noncompliance with regulations or permit conditions must be
reported to the Commission orally within 24 hours followed by a written explanation within 5
days.

Monthly reporting of the following information is required to be submitted for a saltwater
disposal well on a Saltwater Disposal Report (Form 16):

1, Beginning and end of month meter readings.

2. Total barrels injected for the month.

3. Average daily operating injection pressure (this means a typical pressure observed while
the well is injecting, not a mathematical average).

4. Sources of received fluid (these sources need to be listed by well or facility name and
number, NDIC well or facility file number, and the location of each source by
quarter-quarter, section, township, and range).

5. Amount of fluid received from each source.

6. Nature of the received fluid (i.e. produced water, pit water, etc.).

7. Transportation method used to transport the injection fluid to the disposal well site (i.e.

pipeline or truck).

Saltwater Disposal Reports (Form 16) are due on or before the fifth day of the second month
succeeding the month in which the well is capable of disposal (i.e. January report due March 5th).

Pursuant to NDAC Section 43-02-05-13.1, all records from which to make and substantiate
required reports shall be kept for a period of not less than six years.

Lithologic Description

Carson SWD 5301 12-24

Salt Water Disposal Well
McKenzie County, North Dakota
24-153N-101W

The Cretaceous Inyan Kara within the Dakota is roughly 440’ in this area based
on the Oasis Petroleum Wade 5300 21-30H. The section consists of a sequence
of alternating sand, silt and shale. Several potential injection zones occur
between 5,501’ and 5,943° based on the Oasis Petroleum Wade 5300 21-30H.
These zones vary in thickness between 10’ to 80’.

Shales of the Skull Creek and Newcastle units confine the upper boundary of the
Inyan Kara Formation. Individual shale units over 60° thick are inter-bedded
with thinner siltstones.

The Swift Shale consists of fine siltstones in the upper portion that grade into
shales in the lower half of the unit. This formation spans 350’ based on the Oasis
Petroleum Wade 5300 21-30H.

Proposed Injection Program

November 25, 2014

Carson SWD 5301 12-24

Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC
Section 24, T153N R101W

McKenzie County, North Dakota

Application for Fluid Injection
PROPOSED INJECTION PROGRAM

The Carson SWD 5301 12-24 well will be used to inject produced water from wells in the Baker Field-
Oasis Bakken and Three Forks wells- already on production, in the process of eompletion, and those soon
to be drilled in the four township area of 152-153N and 100-101 W into the Dakota formation. Injection
depths will be determined after the well is drilled and logged.

The source wells for the produced water are listed on Exhibit 6 but will also include additional Bakken
and Three Forks wells yet to be drilled and completed. Water from these wells will be shipped via
pipeline to the Carson SWD 5301 12-24 disposal site; trucking will only be done for emergency and/or
unplanned circumstances. The amount of water injected into the Dakota is pressure dependent, but not to
exceed 4,550 psig at surface.

l¥s0
The proposed Carson SWD 5301 12-24 is needed to provide a more local disposal facility in the area to
reduce costs and ease the burden on regional disposal wells. The anticipated initial injection rate of the
well will be 10,000 bwpd at 1,000 psig pressure. However, this rate may increase with additional drilling

in the area, subject to the maximum pressure ceiling. maxi vin IWlection VAte,

Survey Requirements for Horizontal, Horizontal Re-entry, and Directional Wells

NDAC Section 43-02-03-25 (Deviation Tests and Directional Surveys) states in part (that) the survey contractor
shall file a certified copy of all surveys with the director free of charge within thirty days of completion. Surveys
must be submitted as one electronic copy, or in a form approved by the director. However, the director may
require the directional survey to be filed immediately after completion if the survey is needed to conduct the
operation of the director's office in a timely manner. Certified surveys must be submitted via email in one adobe
document, with a certification cover page to certsurvey@nd.gov. Survey points shall be of such frequency to
accurately determine the entire location of the well bore. Specifically, the Horizontal and Directional well survey
frequency is 100 feet in the vertical, 30 feet in the curve (or when sliding) and 90 feet in the lateral.

Conductors, Rat holes, and Mouse holes
To protect near surface groundwater any conductor, rat, or mouse hole drilled must be constructed with a string of

casing and cemented to ground level. Any such string must be secured at the surface when not in use. In addition, all rat
and mouse holes must be plugged with cement and cut off at least 4’ below final grade within a reasonable timeframe after
the rig completes drilling operations on the pad.

Surface casing cement

Tail cement utilized on surface casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi within 12
hours, and tail cement utilized on production casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi
before drilling the plug or initiating tests.

Logs

NDAC Section 43-02-03-31 requires the running of (1) a suite of open hole logs from which formation
tops and porosity zones can be determined, (2) a Gamma Ray Log run from total depth to ground level elevation
of the well bore, and (3) a log from which the presence and quality of cement can be determined (Standard CBL
or Ultrasonic cement evaluation log) in every well in which production or intermediate casing has been set, this
log must be run prior to completing the well. All logs run must be submitted free of charge, as one digital ‘TIFF
(tagged image file format) copy and one digital LAS (log ASCII) formatted copy. Digital logs may be submitted

on a standard CD, DVD, or attached to an email sent to digitallogs@nd.gov
Thank you for your cooperation.

Sincerely,
