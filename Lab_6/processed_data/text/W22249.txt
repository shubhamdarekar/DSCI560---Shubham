INTRODUCTION

The Slawson Exploration Company, Inc. Magnum 2-36-25H [SE SE Sec. 36, T153N,
R101W] is located ~15 miles south of the town of Williston in McKenzie County, North Dakota
and is part of an ongoing drilling program exploiting the Bakken pool in Baker Field. The well is
the second of three laterals planned for the spacing unit and will consist of a 9,713’ lateral drilled
from south to north, exploiting the eastern third of sections 36 and 25. Directional tools will
build a curve and “land” in the Middle Bakken target within the legal setbacks of the spacing
unit, where 7” production casing will be set to isolate up hole formations. The lateral will be geo-
steered in the ideal target rock, with the goals of drilling efficiently and minimizing doglegs, to a
proposed TD in the NE % of NE 4 of Section 25.

Slawson Exploration Company, Inc. is panning to begin reclamation work on the reserve pit of this well. The surface

DETAILS OF WORK

owner is the State of North Dakota. Any oil in the pit will be skimmed off and used in Invert Mud for drilling other
wells. The water will be disposed of by Slawson at various licensed Slawson injection facilities, such as the Sanish 1-
9SWD. Once the fluids are removed the cuttings were dried and mixed with fly ash for stabilzation. The liner will then
be folded over the stabilized cuttings in the pit and buried approximately 6 ft. deep with back fill and topsoil. The site
will then re-seeded. This construction will be completed by one of the three following contractors pending
availability.

The vertical was drilled to a KOP of 10,287’ MD with 2 HDBS bits. The first drilled from under
casing to 8,422’ MD where it was pulled as planned for the Kibbey bit trip. The second HDBS
bit was replaced at 10,282” MD when KOP was reached. The first bit drilled 6,254’ in 57 hours
for an average ROP of 109.72 ft/hr. The second bit completed the vertical after drilling 1,860’ in
39.5 hours for an average ROP of 47.09 ft/hr. Vertical operations were completed on March 30,
2012.

DIRECTIONAL OPERATIONS

Sperry Sun provided equipment and personnel for MWD and directional services. Sunburst
Consulting, Inc. geologists worked closely throughout the project with Sperry Sun to make
steering decisions and maximize the amount of borehole in the pay zone. Attention was also paid
to providing a smooth lateral wellbore to ease the implementation of the aggressive production
fracture program. Tight adherence to the planned drill line path was required to prevent any
interference with future drill plans in the section. As such, a window of no more than 25’ on
either side of the line was given.

Curve Build

The curve was to drill down 523’ TVD in approximately 890’ MD and required 12 degrees of
build per 100’ (Figures 2 & 3). The curve was drilled with a single 8 %4’’ PDC bit. After reaching
90 degrees a tangent section was put in place to cross the eastern hard line. After completing the
tangent, 7’’ casing was set at 11,115’ MD, 10,802.74" TVD, ~17’ below the Upper Bakken
Shale. Casing and cement took 8 days due to stuck casing and a two-stage cement job. The single
HDBS bit drilled 1,076’ in 68.75 hours for an average drilling rate of 15.65 ft/hr.

The HDBS FXD55M combined with the Sperry directional motor drilled quickly while
providing predictable and generous build rates. The optimal performance of the curve assembly
allowed for increased rotation whilst decreasing time spent on the build section.

The added benefit of predictable build rates made forecasting the TVD of the False Bakken and
Upper Bakken Shale from penetration rates more reliable; this in turn allowed for on the fly
adjustments to the landing target and insured a landing within the desired objective.

O OFFSET INFORMATION

Three previously completed nearby wells were used as offset controls on Magnum 2-36-25H.
The Lindvig 1-35 was drilled in August of 1981 by Texas Gas exploration Corp. 1.1 miles west
of the Magnum 2-36-25H. The Verlin Fossum et al. 26-1 is Red River well drilled by Harper Oil
Co. in December of 1979 approximately 1.9 miles northwest of the Magnum 2-36-25H. The third
offset was the Slawson Exploration Company, Inc.’s Magnum 1-36-25H. The Magnum 1-36-25H
was the first of 3 laterals to be put in sections 36-25. Drilling began in January of 2012 0.8 miles
west of the Magnum 2-36-25H.

During the curve, gamma ray was constantly compared to the offset data to help determine a
proper landing depth. To aid in the landing of the curve, an isopach table (Table 1) was
constructed to measure the distance of select gamma markers to the target depth determined from
the offset wells.

Due to variances in the offset isopachs, a weighted average was used in forecasting a landing
depth. Comparing gamma ray markers at the Magnum 2-36-25H to correlative markers from the
offsets made it easier to predict the probable TVD depth of the Middle Bakken target. With its
proximity, the Lindvig 1-35 most closely resembled gamma ray signatures at the Magnum 2-36-

25H.

VERTICAL OPERATIONS

The Magnum 2-36-25H was spud on March 18, 2012 by Nabors #419 (Figure 1). A 13 %” hole

was drilled with fresh water to 2,168’ MD and isolated with 9 5/8” 36# K-55 casing cemented to
surface. On March 23, 2012 vertical operations began. Upon casing exit the drilling fluid was
changed to diesel invert with a target weight of 9.4 to 9.7 ppg for use in the remaining vertical
and curve. The area surrounding Magnum 2-36-25H was a highly prosperous and well developed
Mission Canyon field. As a result of formational depletion, 901 bbls of invert mud while drilling.

O Lateral

Lateral drilling fluid was ~10.1— 9.65 ppg diesel invert. Two trips were required while drilling
the Magnum 2-36-25H. The first came as penetration rates began to fall and sliding became
difficult at 15,968’ MD. A fresh motor and HDBS bit were put in place to continue the lateral.
Along with the BHA an Ulterra agitator was picked up, but it didn’t appear to decrease the
problems associated with sliding. Drilling on the Magnum 2-36-25H continued until a MD of
18,823” when penetration rates began to fall off. A new motor was put behind the previous bit
along with an NOV agitator. Once back on bottom the penetration rates began to decline even
further suggesting the possibility of a weak motor.

The first assembly drilled 4,610’ in 99.09 hours for an average ROP of 46.52 ft/hr. The Second
assembly drilled 2,885’ in 79 hours for and average speed of 36.14 ft/hr. The final assembly with
the rerun HDBS drilled 1,905’ in 76.1 hours for an average speed of 25.03 ft/hr. The well
reached a total depth (TD) of 20,728’ MD at 01:00 CDT April 27, 2012. The use of a lateral
reamer in the drill string helped to reduce hole drag and over pull which will likely ease the
placing of liner.

GEOLOGIC EVALUATION AND HYDROCARBON SHOWS

Methods

Geologic supervision of Magnum 2-36-25H was provided by Sunburst Consulting, Inc. with two
OC) wellsite geologists. A digital gas detector was interfaced with a Pason electronic data recorder
system. Pason provided drill rate, on-off bottom, and pump strokes to the gas detection computer
and received total gas information from Sunburst for viewing around location. Rig crews caught
lagged samples under the direction of Sunburst geologists (see LITHOLOGY for sample
intervals and descriptions). The sample cuttings were examined wet and dry under a binocular
microscope using both plain (broad spectrum) and transmitted light. Sunburst personnel also
closely examined MWD gamma ray information and penetration rates to aid in steering decisions
and dip rate estimations.

Lithology and Hydrocarbon Shows

Geologic evaluation began at 7,700’ MD in the shale and siltstone of the Amsden Formation.
Samples from this area were described as:

SHALE: reddish orange, subblocky to subplaty, no visible porosity

SILTSTONE: orange, trace dark red, friable, subblocky to subplaty, calcareous cement, poorly cemented

ANHYDRITE: off white, cryptocrystalline, soft, massive, amorphous texture, no visible porosity

The Tyler Formation [Pennsylvanian, Minnelusa Group] was penetrated at 7,858’ TVD
(-5,680’). The Tyler consisted of shale and sandstone that in parts of the basin have produced
notable hydrocarbons. The Magnum 2-36-25H showed an increase in hydrocarbon gas at 8,150’
O MD. Samples from this interval (Figure 4) were described as:

Mission Canyon field. The resulting depletion of formation pressure caused the loss of 901 bbls
of invert drilling fluid. On some occasions the formation would give back fluid along with high
sharp increases in hydrocarbon gas. Large amounts of LCM made it difficult to evaluate overall
Mission Canyon potential. The draw down in pressure, however, could speak to favorable
permeability. Due to heavy sample contamination pictures of cuttings from the Mission Canyon
are not available. Samples from the Mission Canyon were described as:

DOLOMITIC LIMESTONE: mudstone, off white to cream, tan to light brown, light gray brown,
very fine grained, firm to hard, crystalline texture, slightly argillaceous, trace light brown oil stain

DOLOMITE: mudstone, light gray brown, friable, earthy texture, rare to occasional
intercrystalline porosity, rare dark brown spotty oil stain

LIMESTONE: mudstone, dark gray, common off white to cream, microcrystalline, firm, dense,
earthy to trace crystalline texture, rare dark brown spotty oil stain

ARGILLACEOUS LIMESTONE: mudstone, medium to light gray brown, microcrystalline,
friable, earthy texture, rare disseminated pyrite, no visible porosity or oil stain

The Lodgepole Formation [Mississippian, Madison Group] top was drilled at 10,022? TVD
(-7,844’), coming in 34’ lower than the Magnum 1-36-25H. Approximately 750’ of limestone,
much of it argillaceous mudstone with common pyrite and sparry calcite, was drilled in the
Lodgepole. Samples collected from the Lodgepole (Figure 7) were described as:

ARGILLACEOUS LIMESTONE: mudstone, light gray to rare medium gray to trace medium
brown, microcrystalline, firm to trace hard, dense, earthy to trace crystalline texture, trace
siliceous, no visible porosity

LIMESTONE: mudstone, medium gray to rare light gray to rare off white to trace dark gray,
microcrystalline, firm to trace hard, dense, earthy to rare crystalline texture, siliceous in part,
possible intercrystalline porosity, trace dark brown dead spotty oil stain

The “False Bakken” was penetrated at 10,763’ TVD (-8,585’), suggesting a target depth of
10,806’ TVD. The underlying Seallion interval showed gas peaks as high as 1,329 units.

The Upper Shale of the Bakken Formation [Mississippian—Devonian] was drilled at 10,770’
TVD (-8,592’) suggesting a casing point of 10,804’ TVD. The Bakken came in 26’ low to the
Magnum 1-36-25H. Sample returns were typical black, carbonaceous, and petroliferous shale
(Figure 8), characterized by gamma ray values in excess of 400 cps. Background gas climbed
steadily with peaks above 600 units over a background of about 250 units. Samples were
described as:

SHALE: black, firm to friable, sub blocky to sub platy, earthy texture, petroliferous,
carbonaceous, abundant disseminated pyrite, nodular pyrite, no visible porosity

The Middle Member of the Bakken Formation was penetrated at 10,995’ MD, 10,785 TVD
(-8,607°), 25’ low to the Magnum 1-36-25H, suggesting a target of 10,803’ TVD (Table 1).
While drilling the Magnum 2-36-25H, samples varied only slightly within the target area. Some
differences in oil staining could be seen. The upper half of the targeted interval consisted of a
high gamma layer, primarily made up of cream-tan colored silty sandstone with rare to common
oil stain. At times the silty sandstone would be mixed with light gray siltstone stringers. The
lower edge of zone defined as Marker E was well cemented sandstone with occasional stringers
of lime packstone. Samples collected from the Bakken Formation (Figure 9) were described as:

SILTSTONE: medium brown, friable to trace firm, sub blocky to sub platy, calcareous cement,
poorly to trace moderately cemented, trace disseminated pyrite, no visible porosity

SILTY SANDSTONE: cream to off white, very fine grained, friable to trace firm, sub angular to
sub rounded, well sorted, calcareous cement, poorly to trace moderately cemented, trace
disseminated pyrite, possible intergranular porosity, trace dark brown spotty oil stain

The lateral began with a background gas of about 300 units with an average connection gas
O above 500 units. By the time the tangent was drilled and the well bore reached a casing point of
11,358’ MD, background gas had climbed to 350 units, with connections over 1200 units.
Shortly after exiting casing, the bit climbed through section along markers C and B (Figure 11).
The average gas climbed slightly to 400 units with connections reaching 600 units with a high
over 700 units. Background levels decreased as the bit dropped from the top of zone. The bit was
allowed to remain within the D marker but began to drop slightly in section while the laterals
turn was being completed. By 11,500’ MD the bit was hovering just above the E marker and
back ground gas dropped to just over 200u with connections barely reaching 300u. As the
wellbore was pushed up in zone gas levels climbed steadily

As the bit reached 12,900’ gas levels reached a lateral high (Figure 10), with background levels
averaging 800-900 units and connections commonly reaching 2,200 units. That interval also
enjoyed an increase in overall ROP that suggests an encouraging porosity. This lateral peak in
gas was seen between markers “C” and “D”. Increasing spotty black oil stain as well as the more
common dark brown oil stain was seen.

Gas levels continued to decline as the lateral moved forward in part due to the waning drill
speeds lowering the amount of lateral exposed on an hourly basis. By 14,500’ MD gas levels
remained strong between 500-600 units with connections over 1500 units but began decreasing
as the wellbore passed 15,000’ MD.

Despite position in zone staying steady, gas levels continued to decline as the lateral progressed
(Figure 11). A decline was seen by 15,200’ MD where hydrocarbon gas levels lowered to ~300
units on average. Despite low background levels connection gases still peaked to nearly 3,000
units showing indications of strong formation pressure. Gas levels recover briefly as the wellbore
exited the top of zone around 16,050’MD with background levels averaging between 600-700
units. The increase was short lived however and gas levels would reach a lateral low by a MD of
16,600’. Dip profiling suggested that bit was just above marker C. This area had previously seen
a healthy increase in background gases. An increase in calcite cementing and decreasing oil stain
was observed in samples.

Though position in zone changed very little, gas levels did begin to recover by the time the bit
reached a MD of 17,450’. Soon backgrounds of 400-500 units were recorded with accompanying
connection gases averaging close to a 1,000 units. Hydrocarbon gas levels would continue to
increase as the well drilled ahead. By 18,250’ MD the average background gas was over 500
units with connections reaching as much as 2,400 units. These levels would remain steady until
dropping near the completion of Magnum 2-36-25H.

Gas levels dropped slightly to an average of 250-300 units with the majority of connections
cresting near 1,000 units starting just after 19,000’ MD. As Magnum 2-36-25H approached TD,
levels remained with little variance in sample oil staining.

During the lateral there were two trips to surface for BHA changes. The change outs allowed for
the recording of trip gases of 4,087 and 2,700 units. The trip gases were punctuated by a 15°-20’
flare.

Conclusions

The Magnum 2-36-25H shows moderate potential for hydrocarbon production. The intervals
marked as A, B, and C are recorded to have as much as 13% porosity on offsets. The Slawson
fracture program will likely maximize the local porosity matrix and allow for increased
production value. Porosity in some cuttings showed calcite occlusion, the levels of which may
impact permeability. Connection gases at times would reach five-times that of background gases
suggesting a probability of favorable formation pressure. Permeability remains the most likely
limiting factor to Magnum 2-36-25H’s potential but initial numbers from Magnum 1-36-25H
provide encouragement.

Marker A: This marker made up the first 2’ of the zone. Overlying marker A was a dark
siltstone with ‘race spotty brown oil stain and low porosity. The occasions in which the bit
passed into this marker showed decreasing levels of hydrocarbon gas. This is likely due to a
combination of increasing silt content and porosity plugged by increasing calcite cement.

Marker B: Marker B began about 2’ into the target zone and continued until 4’ into zone. This
facies was encountered early in the tangent section before setting casing. It was similar in nearly
every way to marker C. Common characteristics of this marker were increasing siltstone content
and a slight increase in pyrite levels. It is important to note that exceptional porosity was
observed in cuttings and offset electric logs showed porosity up to 13% within this interval. It is
unclear how permeable the interval is, but with production fracturing the increased porosity will
likely benefit overall production. Oil staining varied little within this marker. In general, trace to
rare spotty brown oil stain was seen with areas of spotty black oil stain observed. On offsets, the
gamma reached 90-100 cps, the same as A and C. During lateral drilling, markers A and B
displayed gamma ray measurements between 100-115 cps.

Marker C: Marker C extended from 4’-6’ into the target. This marker appeared slightly warmer
then surrounding markers reaching 120-130 cps. Samples were identical to that of marker B. The
C marker became the most reliable marker for dip calculation. Oil staining was mostly light
brown occasionally increasing to include spotty light black. The majority of the lateral was spent
just above this marker and hydrocarbon gas levels increased with proximity. The increase in gas
could be attributed to the increased porosity exhibited in offset logs. Hydrocarbon gas levels
reached a lateral peak within the bottom of this interval. Background gas levels averaged just
above 1000 units with connections as high as 2500 units.

Marker D: The D marker began about 8’ from the top of zone and in the lateral averaged a 95-
105 cps gamma signature. The indistinct gamma of the structure made it difficult to pinpoint
position and samples shared characteristics with surrounding markers. There were no increases
in oil staining exclusive to marker D. Staining remained similar to other markers within the
Middle Bakken ranging in color from Jight black to light brown.

Marker E: Marker E ranged from 12’-13’ TVD below the top of zone. This interval showed the
most variety in sample. At times trace amounts of lime packstone would be observed as well as
increased contents of sparry calcite and calcareous cement. In general trace to rare spotty brown
oil staining was noted. Levels of hydrocarbon gas decreased when the wellbore passed through
this interval. The drop in gas does coincide with a drop in porosity seen in samples and offset
porosity logs.

Marker F: The first 2’ of marker F made up the last 2’ of zone. The F marker ranged from 110
to 115 cps. A small increase in siltstone within samples also helped to identify the marker. The
siltstone was tight and grey with /ess oil staining then the interblended sandstone. The increase in
siltstone decreased the amount of oil staining observed in samples from this interval.

The target zone within the Middle Bakken is defined as the 14’ zone below gamma marker
“MBKMGR” (Marker A). Slawson feels that optimal hydrocarbon production can be achieved
with the implementation of an aggressive production frac program regardless of position within
the Middle Bakken. The target zone in the Middle Bakken was established based on the samples
and electric logs from nearby offset wells. Prognosis predicted 35’ of viable zone between the
Bakken Shales, the first 9° of which is above the desired target. The Magnum 2-36-25H required
a lateral turn to due north which resulted in the implementation of slides purely for azimuth.

The initial prognosis called for a regional dip of nearly flat 0.09° down causing the pay zone to
drop ~16’ over the course of the two section lateral. Gamma markers from a large collection of
offset data showed little to no definition within the targeted interval. As the lateral progressed,
the “C” marker became the most recognizable and efforts were made to stay stratigraphically
near the peak gamma segment to help analyze formational dip changes.

The bit exited the Upper Bakken Shale at a MD of 10,995’ (10,785 TVD) and passed into the
top of the target interval at a MD of 11,060’ MD (10,796’ TVD). After landing the curve a
tangent section was required in order to cross the sections eastern hard line. The wellbore landed
at a casing point of 11,358’ MD (10,801’ TVD), approximately 16’ TVD into the Middle Bakken
and 5’ below the “MBKMGR” marker (Marker A).

The wellbore continued through zone until contact with marker “E” was seen at a MD of 12,220”
MD. Stratigraphically that put the bit just 2-3’ from the bottom of zone. The bit was pushed up to
gain separation from the bottom of zone. The top of target was estimated to have dropped
approximately 1.2’ TVD for dip of 0.06° down. The marker was seen again a 1,000’ later with
virtually no change in TVD making dip ~flat to 0.02° down.

The bit continued within zone when gamma suggested the bit had contacted marker “C” at a MD
of 14,893’. Contact with this marker suggested the bit was roughly 5’ below the top of target
showing that dip had increase to ~0.14° down. With very few markers available for lateral
navigation the decision to stay near the recognizable “C” marker was made.

The decision made navigation easier but risked the possibility of exiting the top of zone. The bit
would briefly exit the target ata MD of 15,742’ when gamma counts decreased dramatically as
the bit passed into the low gamma interval above marker “A”. Efforts to turn the bit down were
successful and the bit reentered the targeted porosity at ~16,130’ MD. The follow through from
the push down allowed the bit to once again contact marker “C” showing the formations only up
dip. The warm gamma marker had come up 3’ of TVD in 1,523’ of MD for a dip of 0.12°

Formation would turn back down and dip would flatten as the lateral progressed with the “C”
marker staying very close to a TVD of 10,805’. Using the marker, dips of 0.07° and a near flat
0.01° were calculated. Gross dip encountered at the Magnum 2-36-25H is estimated to be 0.02°
down as calculated by the interpretation that formation dropped only 4’ rather than the 16’
suggested by structure maps.

@ SUMMARY

1) The Magnum 2-36-25H was spud on March 18, 2012 by Nabors #419. Vertical
operations were completed on March 30, 2012 after being delayed by an under-pressured
Mission Canyon.

2) Localized depletion of the Mission Canyon made vertical operations difficult; however,
quick and effective use of LCM helped to reduce the loss of drilling fluid that was seen
on the Magnum 1-36-25H. A total of 901 bbls loss were a reduction of over 2,300 bbls
lost at the Magnum 2-36-25H’s predecessor. A mud weight of 9.7 was the maximum
weight that could be maintained without increasing losses. The low weight of the mud
however made the Upper Bakken Shale less stable which likely contributed to
intermediate casing getting stuck.

3) A single HDBS bit drilled a 1,076’ MD curve in 68.75 hours for an average drilling rate
of 15.65 ft/hr. The overall average was decreased do to the long tangent drill that was
required to cross the eastern hard line.

4) Lateral hole drag was reduced with the use of an inline reamer. The ease at which the bit
was able to reach bottom while sliding should indicate a nicely groomed wellbore for
liner insertion.

5) The Slawson Exploration Company, Inc. Magnum 2-36-25H awaits completion
@ operations to determine its ultimate production potential. 4” production liner will be set to
bottom to facilitate an aggressive fracture stimulation program.

DETAILS OF WORK

Slawson Exploration Company, Inc. (SEC!) began drilling the Magnum 2-36-25H well on March 18, 2012. The curve
was drilled to a legal location, 7” casing was ran, and then stuck at 11,104° MD. This is 50° short of the 500° setback
of 11,154’ MD. SECI proposes the use of the Packers Plus mechanical liner system to isolate the portion of the
wellbore that is not across the 500° setback. To maintain the full 10,000 psi differential pressure rating this system
offers, we will set the last 2 packers past the TD of the 8.75" hole at 11,375' MD and into the 6” hole size. This will
isolate the remainder of the lateral. No stimulations will be performed between the shoe and 11,375". A wellbore
diagram is included illustrating the Packers Plus system as well as the Actual Field Survey showing the 7" casing
point location.

A> (0770) |

eke Slawson must accept all liability with the enclosed procedure. The Magnum 2-36-25H cannot be
completed (fracture stimulated) until after Slawson requests a Commission hearing pursuant to NDAC
43-02-03-18.1 (Exception location) and a subsequent decision has been rendered.

Well File # 22249

Dear Khem :

Pursuant to Commission Order No. 18012, approval to drill the above captioned well is hereby given. The
approval is granted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than
the 200' setback from the north & south boundaries and 500' setback from the east & west boundaries within
the 1280 acre spacing unit consisting of All of Sections 36 & 25, T153N R101W. Tool error is not required
pursuant to order.

PERMIT STIPULATIONS: A LOCATION DIKE MUST BE CONSTRUCTED ON THE
NORTHERN PORTION OF THE SITE. ALSO, IN ORDER TO JUSTIFY THE SPACING UNIT,
THE MAGNUM 1-36-25H & MAGNUM 2-36-25H MUST BE DRILLED BACK TO BACK.
ALTERNATIVELY, SLAWSON MUST DRILL THE MAGNUM 1-36-25H IF ONLY ONE WELL IS
DRILLED IN THE SPACING UNIT INITIALLY. LASTLY, SLAWSON MUST CONTACT MARK
BINNS AT 701-220-5989 PRIOR TO LOCATION CONSTRUCTION.

Form 1 Changes & Hard Lines
Any changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC.
The proposed directional plan is at a legal location. The minimum legal coordinate from the well head at casing

point is: 260W. Also, based on the azimuth of the proposed lateral the maximum legal coordinate from the well
head is: 10083N & 260W.

Location Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period)

Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the
approved drilling permit on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report. If circumstances require operations to
commence before the 3rd business day following publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may
be waived by the Director. Application for a waiver must be by sworn affidavit providing the information
necessary to evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f, and any other
information that would allow the Director to conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the
drilling permit, the applicant should retain the permit.

Permit Fee & Notification

Payment was received in the amount of $100 via credit card. It is requested that notification be given
immediately upon the spudding of the well. This information should be relayed to the Oil & Gas Division,
Bismarck, via telephone. The following information must be included: Well name, legal location, permit number,
drilling contractor, company representative, date and time of spudding. Office hours are 8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m.

DETAILS OF WORK

Slawson Exploration Company, Inc. (SECI) requests permission for suspension of drilling for up to (90) for the
referenced well under NDAC 43-02-03-55. (SECI) intends to drill the surface hole with freshwater based drilling mud
and set surface casing with a small drilling rig and move off within 3 to 5 days. The casing will be set at a depth
pre-approved by the NDIC per the Application for Permit to Drill NDAC 43-02-03-21. No saltwater will be used in the
drilling and cementing operations of the surface casing. Once the surface casing Is cemented, a plug or mechanical
seal will be placed at the top of the casing to prevent any foreign matter from getting into the well. A rig capable of
drilling to TD will move onto the location within the (90) previously outlined to complete the drilling and casing plan
as per the APD. The undersigned states that this request for suspension of drilling operations in accordance with
the Subsection 4 of Section 43-02-03-55 of the NDAC, is being requested to take advantage of the cost savings and
time savings of using an initial rig that is smaller than the rig necessary to drill a well to total depth but is not
intended to alter or extend the terms and conditions of, or suspend any obligation under, any oil and gas lease with
acreage in or under the spacing or drilling unit for the above-referenced well. (SECI) understands NDAC 43-02-03-31
requirements regarding confidentiality pertaining to this permit. The lined reserve pit will be fenced immediately after
construction if the well pad is located in a pasture (NDAC 43-02-03-19 & 19.1). (SECI) will plug and abandon the well
and reclaim the well site if the well Is not drilled by the larger rotary rig within (90) days after spudding the well with
the smaller drilling rig.

Survey Requirements for Horizontal, Horizontal Re-entry, and Directional Wells
NDAC Section 43-02-03-25 (Deviation Tests and Directional Surveys) states in part (that) the survey
contractor shall file a certified copy of all surveys with the director free of charge within thirty days of completion.
Surveys must be submitted as one electronic copy, or in a form approved by the director. However, the director
may require the directional survey to be filed immediately after completion if the survey is needed to conduct the
operation of the director's office in a timely manner. Certified surveys must be submitted via email in one adobe
document, with a certification cover page to certsurvey@nd.gov.

Survey points shall be of such frequency to accurately determine the entire location of the well bore.

Confidential status

Your request for confidential status of all information furnished to the Director, or his representatives, is
hereby granted. Such information, except production runs, shall remain confidential for six months commencing
on the date the well is spud.

Confidential status notwithstanding, the Director and his representatives shall have access to all well
records wherever located. Your company personnel, or any person performing work for your company shall
permit the Director and his representatives to come upon any lease, property, well, or drilling rig operated or
controlled by them, complying with all safety rules, and to inspect the records and operation of such wells and to
have access at all times to any and all records of wells. The Commission's field personnel periodically inspect
producing and drilling wells. Any information regarding such wells shall be made available to them at any time
upon request. The information so obtained by the field personnel shall be maintained in strict confidence and
shall be available only to the Commission and its staff.

Drilling pit
Please be advised approval for use of a drilling reserve pit or drill cuttings pit on this site is contingent on
site specific conditions and special pit closure requirements may apply.

Surface casing cement

Tail cement utilized on surface casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi within 12
hours, and tail cement utilized on production casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi
before drilling the plug or initiating tests.

Logs

NDAC Section 43-02-03-31 requires the running of a Cement Bond Log from which the presence of
cement can be determined in every well in which production or intermediate casing has been set and a Gamma
Ray Log must be run from total depth to ground level elevation of the well bore. All logs must be submitted as
one paper copy and one digital copy in LAS (Log ASCII) format, or a format approved by the Director. Image
logs that include, but are not limited to, Mud Logs, Cement Bond Logs, and Cyberlook Logs, cannot be produced
in their entirety as LAS (Log ASCII) files. To create a solution and establish a standard format for industry to
follow when submitting image logs, the Director has given approval for the operator to submit an image log as a
TIFF (*.tif) formatted file. The TIFF (*.tif) format will be accepted only when the log cannot be produced in its
entirety as a LAS (Log ASCII) file format. The digital copy may be submitted on a standard CD, or attached to an
email sent to digitallogs@nd.gov Thank you for your cooperation.
