Introduction

The Oasis Petroleum NA, LLC. Lewis Federal 5300 21-31 6B is in Baker Field of the Williston Basin [Lot
2 Section 31, T153N, R101 W]. The subject well lies approximately 8 miles south of the town of Williston,
in McKenzie County, North Dakota (Figure 1). The Lewis Federal 5300 21-31 6B is the second of two
wells to be drilled on the Lewis Federal 5300 21-31 pad. This pad is set up as a 1,280 acre laydown spacing
unit, with 500’ N/S and 100’ E/W drilling setbacks. The subject well is permitted to drill east from the
surface location in section 31 into section 32. The well consists of a single Middle Bakken Member lateral,
targeting a silty sandstone facies, with intent to intersect porosity and fracture trends enhancing reservoir
quality.

Engineering Operations Overview

The 13 3/8” surface casing for the subject well was preset at a depth of 3,328’ prior to Nabors B21 arrival.
Nabors B21 reentered the subject well on April 6, 2019. Due to the presence of several saltwater disposal
wells in the immediate area the decision was made to set a 9 5/8” isolation casing string through the Inyan
Kara and into the Swift. The 9 5/8” casing was then set to set to a depth of 6,145’. The remainder of the
vertical hole was completed with two 8 34” assemblies. The first vertical assembly drilled to a depth of
8,516’ before being replace due to low ROP, the second vertical assembly drilled to a depth of 10,327’
(KOP). The curve assembly consisted of a Reed TKC56 PDC bit (#4), attached to a 2.38° NOV mud motor
and Scientific Drilling MWD tools drilled to a depth of 11,240’ (casing point). The curve was successfully
landed at 11,240’ MD and 10,793’ TVD, approximately 17’ below the Upper Bakken Shale on May 9,
2019. Seven inch diameter 32# P-110 intermediate casing was then set to 11,215’ MD. The lateral assembly
consisted of a 6” Reed TKC53 PDC (#5) bit, attached to a 1.5° Discovery mud motor, and Scientific drilling
MWD tools. The Lewis Federal 5300 21-31 6B reached a total depth of 20,940’ on May 13, 2019.

Offset Control

Offset well data can be found in the ‘Control Data’ section appended to this report. Offset wells were
essential in providing control, making it possible to develop a prognosis of formation tops and curve landing
target depth. The three primary offsets were, The Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC Lewis Federal 5300
21-31 5B, the Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC, Lewis Federal 5300 31-31H, and the Oasis Petroleum
North America, LLC, Lewis Federal 5300 11-31 4BR. By referencing the gamma signature of these offsets
and using formation thicknesses, a model was formed for the target interval pinpointing a strategic landing.
Formation thicknesses expressed by gamma ray signatures in these offset wells were compared to gamma
data collected during drilling operations in to successfully land the curve.

Geology

Sample evaluation began in the Otter Formation at 8,230’ measured depth (MD). Lagged samples were
caught by Sunburst personnel in 30’ intervals through the vertical and curve, and 50’ intervals in the lateral.
Rock samples were evaluated under wet and dry conditions using a stereo zoom binocular microscope for
the identification of lithology including the presence of porosity and oil. Only observed prospective intervals
are described here, but detailed lithological descriptions for all formations are provided in the “Lithology’
appendix.

The Mission Canyon Formation [Mississippian, Madison Group]
was logged at 9,515' MD, 9,465’ TVD (-7,308' MSL). The Mission
Canyon Formation is described as light gray, cream, tan, and light
brown gray in color. Samples are predominately microcrystalline
and are a firm to friable mudstone. The limestone has an earthy,
rarely crystalline texture. Also noted in in several samples were trace
fossil fragments. The limestone is argillaceous in part throughout
this interval. In certain areas possible intercrystalline porosity was
noted but there was no significant oil staining observed in samples.
Throughout the Mission Canyon gas shows are promising, with an
average background gasses ~110u with several connection gasses
exceeding 200u.

Figure 2. Wet sample cuttings of limestone from the Mission Canyon.

The Bakken Formation

The Upper Bakken Shale Member [Mississippian] was recorded at 10,995' MD, 10,759’ TVD (-8,602'
MSL). Entry into this member is characterized by high gamma counts (>300 APD), elevated background
gas and increased rates of penetration. While drilling through the Upper Bakken Shale gas a background
gas of 1000u was observed, as well as a gas show exceeding 1700u. The distinct black shale is carbonaceous
and petroliferous, as well as, hard and platy. Minerals including disseminated/nodular pyrite and trace
calcite fracture fill was observed.

The Middle Bakken Member [Mississippian-Devonian] was
entered at 11,553’ MD, 10,776' TVD (-8,619' MSL). Samples in the
Middle Bakken are predominantly a light brown gray, light to
medium gray, light brown, and off white in color, silty sandstone.
The silty sandstone is fine to very fine grained, and firm. The
Middle Bakken typically contained sub-round to sub-angular
grains. Samples are smooth, moderately sorted and poorly
cemented by calcite. Rare to trace quantities of disseminated and
nodular pyrite is present as was trace to fair intergranular porosity.
Trace to rare light-medium brown, spotty oil stain was visible in
many of these samples. While drilling the Middle Bakken
background gasses ranged from ~600 to 3000 units while several
shows exceeded 3600u.

Figure 3. Wet sample cuttings of silty sandstone from the Middle Bakken.

Geosteering

Structure maps provided by Oasis Petroleum projected that the structure would have an overall down dip
averaging 89.50°. Below are the two nearest offset wells to the Lewis Federal 5300 21-31 6B. The Lewis
Federal 5300 21-31(Figure 4), drilling west to east, ~0.15 miles north of the subject well, and the Lewis
Federal 5300 31-31H (Figure 5), drilling west to east, ~0.15 miles south of the subject well. Although the
nearby offsets all had an overall dip rate of 89.50°, the structure near a vertical section of 3,500’ varied
considerably. The Lewis Federal 5300 31-31H has a very consistent downward dip rate of ~89.50
throughout the course of the lateral. While the Lewis Federal 5300 21-31 5B has a constant downward dip
rate until ~3,500’ vertical section, where the structure abruptly dips down at a steep >2° for several hundred
feet before flattening, reversing to ~1.2° up dip for several hundred feet, then returning to dip rate more
similar to that of regional structure. In total the synclinal structure observed on the Lewis Federal 5300 21-
31 5B lasted for ~3,200’. Anticipating that the structure could be similar to that observed on the Lewis
Federal 5300 21-31 5B the steering team made a conscious effort to maintain a position low in the target
interval, prior to reaching the syncline structure. Maintaining a position low in zone would allow for the
steep dip rate to be identified in a timely manner.

in the preferred stratigraphic position within the target zone. Using offset well data provided by Oasis
representatives, the target interval was determined to maintain adequate distance from the shale.

The lateral was drilled in less than 3 days from casing exit to total depth, with two lateral assemblies. A
total depth of 20,940’ MD was achieved at 23:05 hours on May 13, 2019. The wellbore was completed
94% within target, opening 9,725’ (measurement taken from uncased lateral portion) of potentially
productive reservoir rock.

Hydrocarbon Shows

Gas was continuously recorded from 8,230’ to the completion of the lateral, along with the monitoring of
free oil at the possum belly and shakers. In the closed mud system, hydrostatic conditions were maintained
near balance, this allowed gas and fluid gains from the well to be evaluated. During the vertical, gas shows
ranging from 10 to 276 units were noted, against a 10.15 to 10.70 pound per gallon (PPG) diesel-invert,
mud weight. Background concentrations in the lateral ranged from 600 to 3000 units, against a 9.4-9.45
PPG saltwater gel drilling fluid (Figure 7). Chromatography of gas revealed typical concentrations of
methane, ethane and propane characteristic of the Middle Bakken (Figure 8). Sample cuttings were
examined for hydrocarbon “cut” by immersion of trichloroethylene and inspection under a UV fluoroscope.
Fluorescent cuts were generally pale yellow in color and had a diffuse habit at a slow to moderate speed.

Summary

The Lewis Federal 5300 21-31 6B is a well in Oasis Petroleum’s horizontal Middle Bakken Member
development program, in McKenzie County, North Dakota. The project was drilled from surface casing to
total depth in 19 days. A total depth of 20,940’ MD was achieved at 23:05 hours on May 13, 2019. The
well-site team worked together to maintain the wellbore in the desired target interval for 94% within target,
opening 9,725’ of potentially productive reservoir rock.

Samples in the Middle Bakken Member are predominantly silty sandstone. These samples are light brown
gray, light to medium gray, light brown, and off white silty sandstone. The silty sandstone is fine to very
fine grained. The middle member typically contained sub-round and occasionally sub-angular grains.
Samples are smooth, moderately sorted and poorly cemented by calcite. Rare quantities of disseminated
and nodular pyrite are present as was trace to fair intergranular porosity. Trace to rare light-medium brown,
spotty oil stain was visible in many of these samples. The overall hydrocarbon “cuts”, gas and hydrocarbon
shows were encouraging and indicate an oil and gas rich system in the Middle Bakken Member.

The well should be regarded as an engineering and geological success based on the combination of:

Maximum exposure to the target
Minimal days from re-entry to total depth
No shale strikes

No sidetracks

The Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC, Lewis Federal 5300 21-31 6B awaits completion operations to
determine its ultimate production potential and commercial value.

Figure 5. Cross-sectional profile of the Lewis Federal 5300 31-31H displaying stratigraphic position and gamma values
(Provided by John O’Donnell, Oasis Petroleum).

The 18’ target interval for the subject well is 9’ below the Upper Bakken Shale and 9’ above the Lower
Bakken Shale. Prior to drilling out of the 7” casing it was determined that the C marker near the center of
target and the featureless D marker in the lower portion of the Middle Bakken were to be the primary
steering guides throughout the course of the lateral (Figure 6). As was intended the assembly was steered
to maintain a position low in the target interval for the first half of the lateral. While doing so the anticipated
steep (1.20°) up dip was observed in time to avoid any
potential proximity to the Upper Bakken Shale.
Although the steep dip rate was present, the structure
was not as extreme as that observed on the Lewis
Federal 5300 21-31 5B or Lewis Federal 5300 11-21
4BR. After drilling past the steep downward structure,
the dip rate reversed for a short interval, then resumed
to a dip rate more similar to regional structure for the
remainder of the lateral. Over the course of the well
the consistent, non-descript gamma in the lower
portion of the target interval proved to be the most
useful steering guide. As was observed on previous
wells within the DSU, regardless of position in zone
the assembly regularly built inclination on rotation.
There did not appear to be any noticeable hard streaks
or intervals that were more or less favorable in relation
to ROP.

Figure 6. Target definition for the Oasis Petroleum, Lewis
Federal 5300 21-31 6B (Provided by John O’Donnell, Oasis
Petroleum).

The Lewis Federal 5300 21-31 6B had an estimated overall formation dip of approximately -0.50°.
Penetration rates, gas shows, gamma ray data, and sample observations were utilized to keep the wellbore

LITHOLOGY

Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC
Lewis Federal 5300 21-31 6B

Sunburst geologists caught 30’ sample intervals from 8,2307-11,240’ and 50’ sample intervals through the
lateral to TD at 20,940’. Additional spot samples were caught through the vertical, curve, and lateral as
needed. Samples were examined wet and dry under a binocular microscope. Sample fluorescent cuts are
masked by invert mud through 11,240’, at which time the drilling fluid was displaced to saltwater. Quantifiers
in order of increasing abundance are trace, rare, occasional, common and abundant. One set of sample
cuttings were packaged and mailed to the North Dakota Geological Survey Core Library, per state
requirement.

DETAILS OF WORK
Oasis Petroleum respectfully requests to amend the surface casing depth to 3300' MD (previously (2157°) due to
potential flowback in the Dakota formation. In order to counteract projected flowback at surface, Oasis needs to
increase mud weight, and lowering the surface casing point will allow this to be performed safely. A DV tool will not
be used.

Attached are revised drill plans reflecting the amended casing points, cement volumes, and other related volumes.

DETAILS OF WORK

Oasis Petroleum North America LLC requests a variance to NDAC 43-02-03-21 for the tubing/packer requirement:
Casing, tubing, and cementing requirements during the completion period immediately following the upcoming
fracture stimulation.

The following assurances apply:

1. the well is equipped with new 29# and 32# casing at surface with an API burst rating of 11,220 psi;

2. The Frac design will ise a safety factor of 0.85 API burst rating to determine the maximum pressure;

3. Damage to the casing during the frac would be detected immediately by montioring equipement;

4. The casing is exposed to significantly lower rates and pressures during flowback than during the frac job;
5. The frac fluid and formation fluids have very low corrosion and erosion rates;

6. Production equipment will be installed as soon as possible after the well ceases flowing;

7. A 300# gauge will be installed on the surface casing during the flowback period

McKenzie County
Well File # 28190
Dear Chelsea:

Pursuant to Commission Order No. 23752, approval to drill the above captioned well is hereby given. The
approval is granted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than
the 500' setback from the north & south boundaries and 200' setback from the east & west boundaries within the
1280 acre spacing unit consisting of Sections 31 & 32’'T153N R100W.

PERMIT STIPULATIONS: Effective June 1, 2014, a covered leak-proof container (with placard) for
filter sock disposal must be maintained on the well site beginning when the well is spud, and must
remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations are
conducted. Due to a drainage adjacent to the well site, a dike is required surrounding the entire
location.,OASIS PETRO NO AMER must contact NDIC Field Inspector Richard Dunn at 701-770-3554
prior to location construction.

Drilling pit

NDAC 43-02-03-19.4 states that “a pit may be utilized to bury drill cuttings and solids generated during well
drilling and completion operations, providing the pit can be constructed, used and reclaimed in a manner that will
prevent pollution of the land surface and freshwaters. Reserve and circulation of mud system through earthen pits
are prohibited. All pits shall be inspected by an authorized representative of the director prior to lining and use.
Drill cuttings and solids must be stabilized in a manner approved by the director prior to placement in a cuttings

pit.”

Form 1 Changes & Hard Lines

Any changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC.
The proposed directional plan is at a legal location. Based on the azimuth of the proposed lateral the maximum
legal coordinate from the well head is: 10074 E.

Location Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period)

Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the
approved drilling permit on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report. If circumstances require operations to
commence before the 3rd business day following publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may
be waived by the Director. Application for a waiver must be by sworn affidavit providing the information
necessary to evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f), and any other
information that would allow the Director to conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the
drilling permit, the applicant should retain the permit.

DETAILS OF WORK
Oasis requests permission for suspension of drilling for up to 90 days for the referenced well under NDAC 43-02-03-
55, Oasis intends to drill the surface hole with freshwater based drilling mud and set surface casing with a small
drilling rig and move off within 3 to 5 days. The casing will be set at a depth pre-approved by the NDIC per the
Application for Permit to Drill NDAC 43-02-03-21. No saltwater wili be used in the drilling and cementing operations of
the surface casing. Once the surface casing Is cemented, a plug or mechanical seal will be placed at the top of the
casing to prevent any foreign matter from getting Into the well. A rig capable of drilling to TD will move onto the
location within the 90 days previously outlined to complete the drilling and casing plan as per the APD. The
undersigned states that this request for suspension of drilling operations in accordance with the Subsection 4 of
Section 43-02-03-55 of the NDAC, Is being requested to take advantage of the cost savings and time savings of using
an initial rig that Is smaller than the rig necessary to drill a well to total depth but Is not intended to aiter or extend the
terms and conditions of, or suspend any obligation under, any oll and gas lease with acreage in or under the spacing
or drilling unlt for the above-referenced well. Oasis understands NDAC 43-02-03-31 requirements regarding
confidentiality pertaining to this permit. The ilned reserve plt will be fenced immediately after construction If the well
pad Is located in a pasture (NDAC 43-02-03-19 & 19.1). Oasis wili plug and abandon the well and reclaim the well site if

Survey Requirements for Horizontal, Horizontal Re-entry, and Directional Wells

NDAC Section 43-02-03-25 (Deviation Tests and Directional Surveys) states in part (that) the survey contractor
shall file a certified copy of all surveys with the director free of charge within thirty days of completion. Surveys
must be submitted as one electronic copy, or in a form approved by the director. However, the director may
require the directional survey to be filed immediately after completion if the survey is needed to conduct the
operation of the director's office in a timely manner. Certified surveys must be submitted via email in one adobe
document, with a certification cover page to certsurvey@nd.gov.
Survey points shall be of such frequency to accurately determine the entire location of the well bore.
Specifically, the Horizontal and Directional well survey frequency is 100 feet in the vertical, 30 feet in the curve
(or when sliding) and 90 feet in the lateral.

RE: Filter Socks and Other Filter Media
Leakproof Container Required
Oil and Gas Wells

Dear Operator,

North Dakota Administrative Code Section 43-02-03-19.2 states in part that all waste material associated with
exploration or production of oil and gas must be properly disposed of in an authorized facility in accord with all
applicable local, state, and federal laws and regulations.

Filtration systems are commonly used during oil and gas operations in North Dakota. The Commission is very
concerned about the proper disposal of used filters (including filter socks) used by the oil and gas industry.

Effective June 1, 2014, a container must be maintained on each well drilled in North Dakota beginning when the
well is spud and must remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations
are conducted. The on-site container must be used to store filters until they can be properly disposed of in an
authorized facility. Such containers must be:

e leakproof to prevent any fluids from escaping the container

e covered to prevent precipitation from entering the container

e placard to indicate only filters are to be placed in the container

If the operator will not utilize a filtration system, a waiver to the container requirement will be considered, but
only upon the operator submitting a Sundry Notice (Form 4) justifying their request.

As previously stated in our March 13, 2014 letter, North Dakota Administrative Code Section 33-20-02.1-01
states in part that every person who transports solid waste (which includes oil and gas exploration and production
wastes) is required to have a valid permit issued by the North Dakota Department of Health, Division of Waste
Management. Please contact the Division of Waste Management at (701) 328-5166 with any questions on the
solid waste program. Note oil and gas exploration and production wastes include produced water, drilling mud,
invert mud, tank bottom sediment, pipe scale, filters, and fly ash.

Thank you for your cooperation.

NDIC — Oil and Gas Division

To whom it may concern:

When Oasis Petroleum drilled the Gramma Federal 5300 41-31T (NDIC #23350) in October of 2012, the

following issues were encountered:

e Dakota formation (est. 11.2 EMW) causing an influx of brine
e Loss zone in the Mission Canyon at weights above ~10.2ppg resulting in significant losses as a
result of high EMW needed for Dakota

The pressured Dakota formation was again seen on the Buck Shot SWD 5201 11-3 (NDIC #90244) at an
estimated equivalent mud weight (EMW) of 11.2ppg.

As a result of proximity, Oasis Petroleum is anticipating the possibility of seeing both the pressured
Dakota and the loss zone in the Mission Canyon. In order to manage this, Oasis Petroleum is proposing
to allow for a contingency string across the Dakota Formation. Contingency plan outlined below in flow
chart. Please refer to attached wellbore diagram for representation of proposed casing design.

Drill 17.5" surface hole. Case with 13-3/8" casing and cement

Drill 8.75" OH through the Dakota formation (into Rierdon) and check for pressure

Pressure

No Pressure
POOH and RIH with 12-1/4"

Run 7" casing and cement
