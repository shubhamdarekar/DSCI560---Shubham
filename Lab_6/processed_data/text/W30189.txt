Introduction

The Oasis Petroleum NA, LLC. Lewis Federal 5300 11-31 2B is located in Baker Field of the Williston
Basin [Lot 1 Section 31, T153N, R101W)]. The subject well lies approximately 8 miles south of the town
of Williston, in the Indian Hills prospect of McKenzie County, North Dakota (Figure 1). The Lewis Federal
5300 11-31 2B is the third of four wells to be drilled on the Lewis Federal 5300 11-31 pad. Due to tight
hole conditions the Lewis Federal 5300 11-31 4B was plugged and abandoned. This pad is set up as a 1,280
acre laydown spacing unit, with 500’ N/S and 100’ E/W drilling setbacks. The subject well is permitted to
drill east from the surface location in section 31 into section 32. The well consists of a single Middle Bakken
Member lateral, targeting a silty sandstone facies, with intent to intersect porosity and fracture trends
enhancing reservoir quality.

Engineering Operations Overview

The Lewis Federal 5300 11-31 2B was spud on January 25, 2019. The surface hole was drilled with one
17.5” assembly to a depth of 3,600’. The complete BHA accomplishments can be found in an appendix to
this report. The 13 3/8” surface casing was set to a depth of 3,598’. Due to the presence of several salt water
disposal wells in the immediate area the decision was made to set a 9 5/8” isolation casing string through
the Inyan Kara and into the Swift. The isolation portion was drilled without issue to a depth of 6,120’. The
9 5/8” casing was then set to set to a depth of 6,107’. The remainder of the vertical hole was completed
with three 8.75” assemblies. The first vertical assembly drilled to a depth of 8,336’ before being replace
due to low ROP, the second drilled to a depth of 8,374 when a mud motor failure was experienced, the third
vertical assembly drilled to a depth of 10,260’ (KOP). The curve assembly consisted of an 8.75” Baker
DDSOSTS PDC bit, a 2.38° NOV mud motor, and Scientific drilling MWD tools. The curve was
successfully landed at 11,150’ MD and 10,769’ TVD, approximately 10’ below the Upper Bakken Shale
on 6 February 2019. Seven inch diameter 32# P-110 intermediate casing was set to 11,091’ MD at landing.
The lateral was completed using two 6” assemblies. The first lateral assembly drilled to a depth of 17,478’
before a trip was required due to an MWD failure. The second and final lateral assembly reached a total
depth of 20,870’ on February 13, 2019.

Offset Control

Offset well data can be found in the ‘Control Data’ section appended to this report. Offset wells were
essential in providing control, making it possible to develop a prognosis of formation tops and curve landing
target depth. The three primary offsets were, The Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC, Wade Federal 5300
41-30 8T3, the Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC, Lewis Federal 5300 31-31H, and the Oasis Petroleum
North America, LLC, Lewis Federal 5300 33-31 3B. By referencing the gamma signature of these offsets
and using formation thicknesses, a model was formed for the target interval pinpointing a strategic landing.
Formation thicknesses expressed by gamma ray signatures in these offset wells were compared to gamma
data collected during drilling operations in to successfully land the curve.

Geology

Sample evaluation began in the Otter Formation at 8,200’ measured depth (MD). Lagged samples were
caught by Sunburst personnel in 30’ intervals through the vertical and curve, and 50’ intervals in the lateral.
Rock samples were evaluated under wet and dry conditions using a stereo zoom binocular microscope for
the identification of lithology including the presence of porosity and oil. Only observed prospective intervals
are described here, but detailed lithological descriptions for all formations are provided in the “Lithology’
appendix.

The Mission Canyon Formation [Mississippian, Madison Group]
was logged at 9,464' MD, 9,444’ TVD (-7,309' MSL). The Mission
Canyon Formation is described as cream, tan, light gray, and light
brown gray in color. Samples are predominately microcrystalline and
are a firm mudstone (Figure 2). The limestone has an earthy, rarely
crystalline texture. Also noted in in several samples were trace fossil
fragments. The limestone is argillaceous in part throughout this
interval. In certain areas possible intercrystalline was noted but there
was no significant oil staining observed in samples. Throughout the
Mission Canyon gas shows are promising, with an average
background gasses ~125u with gas shows peaking at 333u.

The Bakken Formation

The Upper Bakken Shale Member [Mississippian] was recorded at 10,967' MD, 10,743’ TVD (-8,608'
MSL). Entry into this member is characterized by high gamma counts (>300 APD), elevated background
gas and increased rates of penetration. While drilling through the Upper Bakken Shale gas a background
gas of 1300u was observed, as well as a survey gas of 2319u. The distinct black shale is carbonaceous and
petroliferous, as well as, hard and platy. Minerals including disseminated/nodular pyrite and trace calcite
fracture fill was observed.

The Middle Bakken Member [Mississippian-Devonian] was entered
at 11,026’ MD, 10,759' TVD (-8,624' MSL). Samples in the Middle
Bakken are predominantly a light to medium gray, light brown, and
occasionally cream silty sandstone. The silty sandstone is fine to very
fine grained, friable to occasionally firm. The Middle Bakken
typically contained sub-round to sub-angular grains. Samples are
smooth, moderately sorted and poorly cemented by calcite. Rare to
trace quantities of disseminated and nodular pyrite is present as was
trace to fair intergranular porosity. Trace to rare light-medium
brown, spotty oil stain was visible in many of these samples. While
drilling the Middle Bakken background gasses ranged from ~500 to
4500 units while several shows exceeded 5000u.

Figure 3. Wet sample cuttings of silty sandstone from the Middle Bakken.

Geosteering

Structure maps provided by Oasis Petroleum projected that the structure would be a consistent down dip
averaging 89.38° over the course of the lateral. The steering team anticipated the structure to be down at
89.50° the first 4,000’ of vertical section, steepening to an 89.12° to 6,000’ of vertical section, and remaining
near 89.53° for the remainder of the lateral. Due to higher than anticipated build
rates through the curve the wellbore landed only 10’ into the Middle Bakken
and as a result the gamma signatures throughout the middle member were based
on offset wells. Upon exiting casing, and drilling down, it became apparent that
the gamma signature was very similar to that of the Lewis Federal 5300 31-
31H. Since this offset well had the thinnest Middle Bakken (~36’) of the three
offsets it was determined to steer ahead with an anticipated 36’ Middle Bakken,
this technique was also used in drilling the Lewis Federal 5300 11-31 3B. The
target interval was defined by proximity to the shales and not by an ideal
porosity interval. The 16’ target began 10’ below the Upper Bakken Shale and
extended to 10’ above the Lower Bakken Shale. Before drilling out of the 7”
casing it was determined that the cool C marker in the lower half of the target
interval was going to be the most consistent steering guide (Figure 4). The cool
C marker was contacted several times in the lateral. However, over the course
of the lateral the warm B marker and a slightly cool marker near the top of the
target interval proved to be the most beneficial. Near 19,050’ the wellbore
began to build inclination on rotation faster than anticipated and drilled within
~3’ of the Upper Bakken Shale. To avoid contact with the upper member a stop
card was pulled and time drilling was utilized. Regardless of position in zone
the assembly consistently built inclination on rotation. There did not appear to
be any noticeable hard streaks or intervals that were more favorable in relation
to ROP.

Summary

The Lewis Federal 5300 11-31 2B is a well in Oasis Petroleum’s horizontal Middle Bakken Member
development program in McKenzie County, North Dakota. The project was drilled from surface casing to
total depth in 20 days. A total depth of 20,870’ MD was achieved at 21:30 hours on 13 January 2019. The
well-site team worked together to maintain the wellbore in the desired target interval for 96.6% within
target, opening 9,779’ of potentially productive reservoir rock.

Samples in the Middle Bakken Member are predominantly silty sandstone. These samples are light to
medium gray, light brown, and occasionally cream silty sandstone. The silty sandstone is fine to very fine
grained. The middle member typically contained sub round and occasionally sub-angular grains. Samples
are smooth, moderately sorted and poorly cemented by calcite. Rare quantities of disseminated and nodular
pyrite are present as was trace to fair intergranular porosity. Trace to rare light-medium brown, spotty oil
stain was visible in many of these samples. The overall hydrocarbon “cuts”, gas and hydrocarbon shows
were encouraging and indicate an oil and gas rich system in the Middle Bakken Member.

The well should be regarded as an engineering and geological success based on the combination of:

e Maximum exposure to the target
e Minimal days from re-entry to total depth
e No side-tracks, shale strikes, or collision with existing wellbores

The Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC, Lewis Federal 5300 11-31 2B awaits completion operations to
determine its ultimate production potential and commercial value.

A GEOLOGY SERVICE


The Lewis Federal 5300 11-31 2B had an estimated overall formation dip of approximately -0.59°.
Penetration rates, gas shows, gamma ray data, and sample observations were utilized to keep the wellbore
in the preferred stratigraphic position within the target zone. Using offset well data provided by Oasis
representatives, projected porosity zones were identified and used as preferred drilling areas.

The lateral was drilled in less than 5 days from casing exit to total depth, with two lateral assembly. A total
depth of 20,870’ MD was achieved at 21:30 hours on February 13, 2019. The wellbore was completed
96.6% within target, opening 9,799’ (measurement taken from uncased lateral portion) of potentially
productive reservoir rock.

Hydrocarbon Shows

Gas was continuously recorded from 3,600’ to the completion of the lateral, along with the monitoring of
free oil at the possum belly and shakers. In the closed mud system, hydrostatic conditions were maintained
near balance, this allowed gas and fluid gains from the well to be evaluated. During the vertical, gas shows
ranging from 10 to 350 units were noted, against a 9.1 to 12.85 pound per gallon (PPG) diesel-invert, mud
weight. Gas shows were significantly higher prior to 17,400’. Chromatography of gas revealed typical
concentrations of methane, ethane and propane characteristic of the Middle Bakken (Figure 5). Background
concentrations in the lateral ranged from 300 to 5000 units, against a 9.45-9.6 PPG saltwater gel drilling
fluid (Figure 6). Sample cuttings were examined for hydrocarbon “cut” by immersion of trichloroethylene
and inspection under a UV fluoroscope. Fluorescent cuts were generally pale yellow in color and had a
diffuse habit at a slow to moderate speed.

LITHOLOGY

Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC
Lewis Federal 5300 11-31 2B

Sunburst geologists caught 20’ sample intervals from 4,570’-4,790’; 30’ sample intervals from 8,200’ to 11,150’; and
50’ sample intervals to the TD of the lateral at 20,870’. 10’ spot samples were caught through the vertical, curve, and
lateral as needed. Formation tops and lithologic markers have been inserted into the sample descriptions below for
reference. Samples were examined wet and dry under a binocular microscope. Sample fluorescent cuts are masked
by invert mud through intermediate casing. Quantifiers in order of increasing abundance are trace, rare, occasional,
common and abundant.

DETAILS OF WORK
Oasis Petroleum respectfully requests to amend the surface casing depth to 3600' MD (previously 2136’) due to
potential flowback in the Dakota formation. In order to counteract projected flowback at surface, Oasis needs to
increase mud weight, and lowering the surface casing point will allow this to be performed safely.

DETAILS OF WORK

Oasis Petroleum North America LLC requests permission for suspension of drilling for up to 90 days for the
referenced well under NDAC 43-02-03-55. Oasis Petroleum North America LLC intends to drill the surface hole with
freshwater based drilling mud and set surface casing with a small drilling rig and move off within 3 to 5 days. The
casing will be set at a depth pre-approved by the NDIC per the Application for Permit to Drill NDAC 43-02-03-21. No
saltwater will be used in the drilling and cementing operations of the surface casing. Once the surface casing is
cemented, a plug or mechanical seal will be placed at the top of the casing to prevent any foreign matter from getting
into the well. A rig capable of drilling to TD will move onto the location within the 90 days previously outlined to
complete the drilling and casing plan as per the APD. The undersigned states that this request for suspension of
drilling operations in accordance with the Subsection 4 of Section 43-02-03-55 of the NDAC, is being requested to .
take advantage of the cost savings and time savings of using an initial rig that is smaller than the rig necessary to
drill a well to total depth but is not intended to alter or extend the terms and conditions of, or suspend any obligation
under, any oi! and gas lease with acreage in or under the spacing or drilling unit for the above-referenced well. Oasis
Petroleum North America LLC understands NDAC 43-02-03-31 requirements regarding confidentiality pertaining to
this permit. The drilling pit will be fenced immediately after construction if the well pad is located in a pasture (NDAC
43-02-03-19 & 19.1). Oasis Petroleum North America LL will plug and abandon the well and reclaim the well site if the
well is not drilled by the larger rotary rig within 90 days after spudding the well with the smaller drilling rig.

Oasis must notify NDIC Field Inspector Richard Dunn @701-770-3554 with spud and TD.

Dear Heather:

Pursuant to Commission Order No. 23752, approval to drill the above captioned well is hereby given. The
approval is granted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than
the 500' setback from the north & south boundaries and 200' setback from the east & west boundaries within the
1280 acre spacing unit consisting of Sections 31 & 32 T153N R100W. Tool error is not required pursuant to
order.

PERMIT STIPULATIONS: Effective June 1, 2014, a covered leak-proof container (with placard) for
filter sock disposal must be maintained on the well site beginning when the well is spud, and must
remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations are
conducted. OASIS PETRO NO AMER must contact NDIC Field Inspector Richard Dunn at 701-770-
3554 prior to location construction.

Drilling pit

NDAC 43-02-03-19.4 states that “a pit may be utilized to bury drill cuttings and solids generated during well
drilling and completion operations, providing the pit can be constructed, used and reclaimed in a manner that will
prevent pollution of the land surface and freshwaters. Reserve and circulation of mud system through earthen pits
are prohibited. All pits shall be inspected by an authorized representative of the director prior to lining and use.
Drill cuttings and solids must be stabilized in a manner approved by the director prior to placement in a cuttings

pit.”

Form 1 Changes & Hard Lines

Any changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC.
The proposed directional plan is at a legal location. Based on the azimuth of the proposed lateral the maximum
legal coordinates from the well head are: 473 N & 10097 E.

Location Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period)

Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the
approved drilling permit on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report. If circumstances require operations to
commence before the 3rd business day following publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may
be waived by the Director. Application for a waiver must be by sworn affidavit providing the information
necessary to evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f, and any other
information that would allow the Director to conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the
drilling permit, the applicant should retain the permit.

RE: Filter Socks and Other Filter Media
Leakproof Container Required
Oil and Gas Wells

Dear Operator,

North Dakota Administrative Code Section 43-02-03-19.2 states in part that all waste material associated with
exploration or production of oil and gas must be properly disposed of in an authorized facility in accord with all
applicable local, state, and federal laws and regulations.

Filtration systems are commonly used during oil and gas operations in North Dakota. The Commission is very
concerned about the proper disposal of used filters (including filter socks) used by the oil and gas industry.

Effective June 1, 2014, a container must be maintained on each well drilled in North Dakota beginning when the
well is spud and must remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations
are conducted. The on-site container must be used to store filters until they can be properly disposed of in an
authorized facility. Such containers must be:

e leakproof to prevent any fluids from escaping the container

e covered to prevent precipitation from entering the container

e placard to indicate only filters are to be placed in the container

If the operator will not utilize a filtration system, a waiver to the container requirement will be considered, but
only upon the operator submitting a Sundry Notice (Form 4) justifying their request.

As previously stated in our March 13, 2014 letter, North Dakota Administrative Code Section 33-20-02.1-01
states in part that every person who transports solid waste (which includes oil and gas exploration and production
wastes) is required to have a valid permit issued by the North Dakota Department of Health, Division of Waste
Management. Please contact the Division of Waste Management at (701) 328-5166 with any questions on the
solid waste program. Note oil and gas exploration and production wastes include produced water, drilling mud,
invert mud, tank bottom sediment, pipe scale, filters, and fly ash.

Thank you for your cooperation.

Hello Dave,

Below is the comments from construction regarding the wells on fill as requested. Page 4 of the plats shows
the production layout. We only have pumping units planned for onsite with production going to an offsite
CTB. Please let me know if you need further information on the CTB.

Once permits have been received, | will work with Cody Vanderbusch to get approval on the offsite pit. He
has requested well file numbers be issued prior to submitting a sundry. With the sundry, we will include a
landowner agreement and plat showing the offsite cutting pit. If for any reason the pit is not approved, we
will haul cuttings to an appropriate disposal or work with the NDIC for another solution.

Sincerely,

Victoria Siemieniewski

Subject: RE: Lewis Federal 5300 11-31 2T, 3B, 4T2, 5T Well Pad

Victoria,

Regarding the question of geotech: While there are places in the Indian Hills field where glacial till
overburden is present, this area is comprised primarily of bedrock clays, sandy clays and layers of sandstone.
During construction this material is placed, compacted in lifts, and tested to ensure proper compaction has
been achieved. Any material (coal, topsoil, large rocks/sandstone, etc) encountered during construction is
removed and kept out of the compacted fill sections of the pad. Having successfully constructed numerous
pads with extensive fill sections in this area, some with fills over 45’, we feel confident in our supervision and
seasoned contractors that the additional time and expense associated with formal geotechnical review of
each pad is not warranted at this time.

Josh, Remove the pit and have the plats updated. produce an offsite pit plat. I’m assuming you have already
gotten with facilities and have the production facility info Victoria needs (see comments below)....?

If there is anything else, please let me know.

Thanks
