Figure 1. Nabors B22 drilling the Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC - Yukon 5300 41-12T
during June and July, 2013 in Camp Field, McKenzie County, North Dakota.
(G. Wayne Peterson, Sunburst Consulting)

INTRODUCTION

Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC. Yukon 5301 41-12T [SW SW Sec. 12-T153N-R101W] is
located approximately 3 miles south of Williston in McKenzie County, North Dakota. The
Yukon 5301 41-12T is a horizontal Three Forks development well in part of Oasis Petroleum’s
Camp prospect within the Williston Basin. The vertical hole was planned to be drilled to
approximately 10,335’. The curve would be built at 12 degrees per 100’ to land within the Three
Forks. This well is a two section lateral which originates in the southwest quarter of section 12,
then drilled south across section 13, to the southwest quarter of section 24 (Figure 2). Directional
drilling technologies and geo-steering techniques were used to land in the upper Three Forks
reservoir and maintain exposure to the ideal target rock.

ENGINEERING

Ryan Energy Technologies provided personnel and equipment for measurement-while-drilling
(MWD) services. The RPM directional drillers MWD and Sunburst Consulting personnel
worked closely together throughout the project to evaluate data and make steering decisions to
maximize the amount of borehole in the targeted zones and increase rate of penetration (ROP) of
the formation.

Vertical

The Yukon 5301 41-12T was spud on 18 June, 2013 by Nabors B22. A 13 %” hole was drilled
with fresh water to 2,127’ and isolated with 9 %” J-55 casing cemented to surface. After surface
casing was set, the drilling fluid was changed to diesel invert with target weight of 9.6-10.2 ppg
for the vertical hole and 10.3-10.55 ppg for curve operations. The vertical hole was drilled from
surface casing with bit #2 a Security MMDS55M attached to a Hunting 7/8 low speed motor. This
assembly drilled to the KOP of 10,300’ MD, drilling 8,173’ in 65 hours.

Curve

The 873’ curve was drilled in 22.5 hours with bit #3 a Security MMDS5SD, attached to a 2.38
degree fixed National 7/8 5 stage mud motor and MWD tools. The curve was successfully landed
at 11,173’ MD, approximately 8’ into the Three Forks Formation. Seven inch diameter 32#
HCP-110 casing was set to 11,173’ MD. During casing operations circulation was lost. Casing

OFFSET WELLS

The primary offset wells used for depth correlation during curve operations were the Gulf Oil
Exploration and Production, Lindvig 1-11-3C; and the Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC
Ash Federal 5300 11-18T. The Gulf Oil Exploration and Production, Lindvig 1-11-3C [SE SE
Sec. 11, TI153N, R101W] is located approximately 2 of a mile west of the Yukon 5301 41-12T.
This well was completed in March of 1982 reached a total depth of 13,800’ true vertical depth
(TVD). The Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC Ash Federal 5300 11-18T [Lot 1 Section 18,
T153N, R1O0W] is located approximately east north east of the Yukon 5301 41-12T. This well
was drilled to the Three Forks landing of 10,794’ MD in August and September of 2012. The
formation thicknesses expressed by gamma signatures in these wells, and the Oasis Petroleum
North America, LLC Larry 5301 44-12B [SE NE Section 12, TI153N, R101W] were used to
assist in landing the curve. This was accomplished by comparing gamma signatures from the
offset wells to gamma data collected during drilling operations. The casing target landing was
periodically updated to ensure accurate landing of the curve. Data used in this evaluation are
included as an appendix to this report.

was worked up and down in an attempt to restore circulation, but all efforts to restore circulation
failed. A wire-line truck was called in and casing was perforated at 10,820’ MD. Circulation was
restored and casing was cemented.

Lateral

After completion of curve operations, MWD tools and bit #4, a 6” Security MMD64D PDC bit,
attached to a 1.5° adjustable Baker XLLS low speed motor were run in the hole. This bottom
hole assembly (BHA) drilled 2,502’ in 47 hours before erratic pulses from the MWD tool caused
it to be tripped out of hole (TOH). A new BHA consisting of bit #5 a Smith MDSI613QBPX
PDC bit, a new 1.5° adjustable Baker XLLS low speed motor and new MWD tools were tripped
into the hole (TIH). This assembly drilled 2,502’ in 47 hours before the MWD tool ceased
pulsing, and this BHA was TOH. A new assembly consisting of bit #6 a Smith MDSI613QBPX
PDC bit, a new 1.5° adjustable Baker XLLS low speed motor and new MWD tools were tripped
into the hole. This assembly drilled 3,165’ in 56 hours before poor penetration rates caused it to
be TOH. A new assembly consisting of bit #7 a Varel VM613P2 PDC bit, a new 1.5° adjustable
Baker XLLS low speed motor and the previously run MWD tools were tripped into the hole.
This assembly drilled to 20,573’, drilling 904’ in 23 hours before an encounter with the
pronghorn caused a sidetrack. The BHA was tripped back to 20,275’ MD and the hole was
troughed, then time drilled for a sidetrack. The sidetrack was unsuccessful, consequently bit #7
after time drilling 5’ in 21 hours was TOH. A new assembly consisting of bit #8, a Smith
MDSI613 attached to a NOV 7/8 3.8 motor along with new MWD tools was assembled and TIH
for sidetrack attempt #2. This sidetrack was successful; this assembly drilled 457’ in 27 hours
before poor penetration rates caused it to be TOH. A new BHA consisting of bit #9 a 6” Security
MMD64D PDC bit, a new 1.5° adjustable Baker XLLS low speed motor and new MWD tools
were tripped into the hole. This assembly drilled to TD, drilling 498’ in 8.5 hours.

Total depth of 21,220’, with a final azimuth of 175.70° and inclination of 89.5° was achieved at
1550 hours CDT July 16, 2013. The resulting final vertical section was 10,522.61’. The bottom
hole location (BHL) is 10,504.47 south & 618.46' east of surface location or approximately
295.55' FSL & 1,328.46' FWL, SE SW Sec. 24, T153N, R101W. The hole was then circulated
and reamed for completion.

This section was approximately 12’ thick, its base, as indicated by the transition to faster
penetration rates and higher gamma API counts is indicative of the Upper Berentson which was
drilled at 9,138' MD 9,136' TVD (-7,017') SS.

The Ratcliffe interval [Charles Formation] was drilled at 9,264' MD 9,262' TVD (-7,143') SS.
The top of this interval was observed as faster penetration rates were encountered, as the well
bore transitioned from anhydrite to limestone mudstone. This limestone was tan to light brown,
occasional light gray tan, rare off white lime mudstone. This facies was microcrystalline, firm,
with an earthy and crystalline texture and contained a trace of disseminated pyrite. Also noted in
certain areas was a trace light brown oil stain; possible earthy to intercrystalline porosity may
have been present

The Mission Canyon Formation [Mississippian Madison Group] was logged at 9,444' MD 9,442'
TVD (-7,323') SS. The Mission Canyon Formation consisted of lime mudstone that was
described as light gray, light gray brown, light brown to brown, gray brown, rare off white, trace
gray in color. The microcrystalline was predominately friable to firm, dense with an earthy to
crystalline texture. Some intervals were trace siliceous with traces of disseminated pyrite. Fossil
fragments, along with black, dark brown algal laminations were visible in some samples
throughout the Mission Canyon Formation. Following connections or downtime (periods of non-
circulation), gas shows of 27 to 37 units were noted A trace to rare spotty light brown and dark
brown dead spotty oil stain was occasionally observed while logging the Mission Canyon
Formation.

Formation.

The Lodgepole Formation [Mississippian Madison Group] was encountered at 10,003' MD
10,001' TVD (-7,882’) SS. This interval was characterized by medium to light gray, occasional
medium gray tan, rare dark gray, trace light gray brown, trace black gray, argillaceous lime
mudstone which was evidenced by the elevated gamma. The lithology was further characterized
as being microcrystalline, firm, and dense, with an earthy texture. Also present in certain areas
were traces of algal laminations and fossil fragments. Disseminated pyrite was also seen in the
samples as a trace mineral. No significant gas shows were noted in this formation.

GEOLOGY

Methods

Geologic analysis for the Yukon 5301 41-12T was provided by Sunburst Consulting, Inc.
Information was networked through Rig-watch’s electronic data recorder system. This
information network provided depth, drilling rate, pump strokes and total gas units to multiple
areas throughout the well site. Gas data was fed from Sunburst’s digital gas detector, a total gas
chromatograph, through Rig-watch for dissemination. Hydrocarbon constituents (C; through C4)
were recorded in part-per-million concentrations. Gas sampling was pulled through 4” polyflo
tubing after agitation in Sunburst’s gas trap at the shakers. Rig crews caught lagged samples at
the direction of the well site geologists. Samples were collected at 30’ intervals in the
vertical/curve and 30’ intervals in the lateral. Rock cuttings were analyzed in wet and dry
conditions under a 10x45 power binocular microscope (for detailed lithologic descriptions see
appendix). Cuttings were sent to North Dakota Geologic Survey. In addition to rock samples,
rate of penetration and gamma ray data were also used in geologic analysis to aid geo-steering
and dip calculations.

Lithology

Formation analysis began at 8,240’ MD with a siltstone and anhydrite characteristic of the
Kibbey Formation [Mississippian Big Snowy Group]. This interval consisted of an earthy, red to
orange, red brown, light orange to off white, trace light brown, friable siltstone that was
moderately calcite cemented with an earthy texture. The Kibbey “Lime” was logged at 8,366'
MD 8,365' TVD (-6,246') (SS). This marker is represented by an off white anhydrite which was
microcrystalline, soft, massive, and amorphous. The anhydrite is often accompanied by slower
penetration rates as the bit transitions out of the overlying siltstone. The rate of penetration
(ROP) then increases as the bit exits the anhydrite cap to this marker and enters the underlying
limestone mudstone to wackestone. This carbonate was described as a light gray light gray
brown, off white lime mudstone which was microcrystalline, friable, and dense with an earthy
texture. Samples in the lower section consisted of red to orange, red brown, light orange to off
white, trace light brown, friable and blocky siltstone with calcite cement moderately cemented.
This facies was interbedded with soft, off white amorphous or microcrystalline anhydrite.

The Charles Formation [Mississippian Madison Group] consisted of salt, anhydrite, limestone
and argillaceous lime mudstone. The first Charles salt was drilled at 8,508' MD 8,507' TVD (-
6,338') SS. The Base of the Last Salt (BLS) was logged at 9,214' MD 9,212' TVD (-7,093') SS as
indicated by slower penetration rates and increased weight on bit. The beds of salt within the
Charles Formation can be identified by an increase in penetration rates and lower API gamma
count rates. Samples of the salt intervals were described as frosted, translucent, anhedral to
subhedral, with no visible porosity. Slower penetration rates were observed as the bit
encountered sections of light brown, gray brown, gray, gray brown lime mudstone which was
friable to firm and dense, with an earthy texture. This limestone was argillaceous in part in areas
where gamma API counts were elevated, and contained a trace of disseminated pyrite. No visible
oil stain was noted. In areas where the penetration rates were slowest anhydrite was logged.
These samples were described as off white, light gray, soft, massive and amorphous. Within the
Charles Formation at 9,126’ MD slower penetration rates indicated the presence of anhydrite.

The “False Bakken” [Lodgepole Formation] was drilled at 10,749' MD 10,697' TVD (-8,578')
SS, and the Scallion limestone at 10,752' MD 10,700’ TVD (-8,581') SS. Samples from the False
Bakken are typically brown, black, shale, friable, subblocky with an earthy texture. This facies is
calcareous, with traces of disseminated pyrite. Gas levels were slightly elevated through this
interval with a maximum connection gas of 748 units likely due to fracture porosity.

The Upper Bakken Shale Member [Mississippian-Bakken Formation] was drilled at 10,765' MD
10,709' TVD (-8,590') SS. Entry into this member was characterized by high gamma, elevated
background gas and increased rates of penetration. The black carbonaceous and petroliferous
shale was sub blocky and firm with an earthy texture. Trace minerals were observed to include
disseminated pyrite and calcite fracture fill, representing possible fracture porosity.
Hydrocarbons evaluated in this interval reached a maximum of 916 units.

The Bakken Middle Member [Mississippian-Devonian] was reached at 10,793' MD 10, 724'
TVD (-8,605') SS. This formation was predominantly siltstone and silty sandstone noted by the
decreasing penetration rates, gamma API counts, and recorded gas levels, relative to the
overlying source rock. The siltstone was light gray, light gray brown, sub-blocky, with an earthy
texture. It was moderately calcite cemented, with a trace of disseminated pyrite. Also present
was silty sandstone which was light gray, light brown, light gray brown, friable, very fine
grained, well sorted, friable, sub-angular to sub-round, and contained possible intergranular
porosity. It was moderately calcite cemented. Trace minerals included disseminated and nodular
pyrite. Drilling gas in this interval reached a maximum of 154 units. Also observed was spotty
light brown spotty oil stain.

The Lower Bakken Shale Member [Devonian] was reached at 10,885' MD 10,767' TVD (-8,648')
SS. This was 6’ to the Lindvig 1-11-3C. Entry into this interval was characterized by high
gamma, elevated background gas and increased rates of penetration. The carbonaceous black
shale is petroliferous, with an earthy texture and exhibits possible fracture porosity. Trace
minerals included disseminated pyrite. Drilling gas in this interval reached a maximum of 135
units with a connection gas of 158 units.

Figure 5. Sample of gray siltstone from the Pronghorn Member.

The Pronghorn Member [Devonian-Bakken Formation] was reached at 10,917' MD 10,775' TVD
(-8,656') SS. Entry into this interval was characterized by lower gamma, and slightly slower
penetration rates. Samples from the Pronghorn were described as a siltstone which was medium
to dark gray, friable, sub-platy to sub-blocky, with an earthy texture. The siltstone was
moderately dolomite cemented and included disseminated and nodular pyrite. Drilling gas in this
interval reached a maximum of 91 units with a connection gas of 142 units.

The Three Forks Formation [Devonian] was reached at 10,995' MD 10,794' TVD (-8,675') SS.
The target zone of the Three Forks was to be drilled in the dolomitic facies in a ten foot zone
beginning 8 feet into the Three Forks Formation. This target zone was later revised to an 8 foot
drilling zone located sixteen feet into the Three Forks Formation. The revised plan was
implemented to avoid deflections from multiple tight streaks located high in formation, and to
take advantage of the low gamma primarily dolomitic facies, which proved useful for steering
decisions.

Figure 6. Sample of the predominately dolomitic facies in the updated preferred drilling zone of the Three
Forks formation on left; sample of the underlying claystone on the right.

Samples in the Three Forks were commonly dolomite which was tan to light brown, occasional
medium brown, occasional off white to cream. Additionally this facies was friable with an earthy
texture. It also contained a trace of disseminated and nodular pyrite. Possible intercrystalline
porosity was observed, as was a rare to a trace of light brown spotty oil stain. Present in varying
amounts was light gray, off white, rare light green to mint green shale which was friable to firm,
sub-blocky with an earthy texture. Trace of nodular and disseminated pyrite was noted, and the
shale contained no visible porosity.

Gas Show

Gas monitoring and fluid gains provided evidence of a hydrocarbon saturated reservoir during
the drilling of the Yukon 5301 41-12T. Oil and gas shows at the shakers and in samples were
continuously monitored. In the closed mud system, hydrostatic conditions were maintained near
balance, this allowed for gas and fluid gains from the well to be evaluated. Gas on the Yukon
5301 41-12T varied according to penetration rates and stratigraphic position. Background
concentrations ranged from 150 to 250 units, and connection peaks of 300 to 500 units were

Geo-steering

Geologic structure maps of the Yukon 5301 41-12T and surrounding control wells, estimated
formational dip to move down at approximately -0.3° initially, then reverse due to a plunging
syncline at about 2,500’, reversing to an estimated 0.5° to 1.0° until total depth (TD) was
reached. The Yukon 5301 41-12T preferred drilling interval consisted of a ten foot zone located
approximately eight feet into the Three Forks Formation. Stratigraphic position in the target zone
was based on penetration rates, gas shows, gamma ray data and sample observations. The
projected target landing was to be ten feet into the Three Forks and was successfully reached
prior to casing operations. Using offsets provided by Oasis representatives, projected porosity
zones were identified as the preferred drilling areas (Figure 9).

2,256, 5,778, 6,745, and 2,423 units respectively. Chromatography of gas revealed typical
concentrations of methane, ethane, propane and butane characteristic of Bakken and Three Forks
gas (Figure 7).

SUMMARY

The Yukon 5301 41-12T is a successful well in Oasis Petroleum’s horizontal Three Forks
development program in Baker Field. The project was drilled from surface casing to TD in 19
days. The TD of 21,220’ MD was achieved at 1550 hours CDT July 16, 2013. The well site team
worked well together maintaining the well bore in the desired target interval for 88% of the
lateral, opening 10,225’ of potentially productive reservoir rock.

Diesel invert drilling fluid 9.6-10.2 ppg for the vertical hole and 10.3-10.55 ppg for curve
operations were used to maintain stable hole conditions, minimize washout through the salt
intervals and permit adequate analysis of mud gas concentrations.

Samples in the Three Forks were commonly dolomite which was tan to light brown, occasional
medium brown, occasional off white to cream. Additionally this facies was friable with an earthy
texture. It also contained a trace of disseminated and nodular pyrite. Possible intercrystalline
porosity was observed, as was a rare to a trace of light brown spotty oil stain. Present in varying
amounts was light gray, off white, rare light green to mint green shale which was friable to firm,
sub-blocky with an earthy texture. Trace of nodular and disseminated pyrite was noted, and the
shale contained no visible porosity.

Samples tended to contain a greater quantity of the tan to cream, rare off white dolomite where
gamma values were lower, and relatively a greater quantity of the blue green gray shale where
gamma values were higher. Where the low gamma was encountered in the bottom of the target
interval, thin layers of dolomite contained possible fair to good intercrystalline porosity and
common spotty light to medium brown oil staining.

Gas on the Yukon 5301 41-12T varied according to penetration rates and stratigraphic position
of the well bore. Observed concentrations ranged from 150 to 250 units background, and
connection peaks of 300 to 500 units were observed in the middle portion of formation where
shows were the best while drilling in the lateral. Trips at 13,675’ MD, 16,506’ MD, 19,671’ MD,
and 20,265’ MD, yielded trip gases of 2,256, 5,778, 6,745, and 2,423 units respectively

The Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC. Yukon 5301 41-12T awaits completion operations to
determine its ultimate production potential.

After exiting intermediate casing the well-bore onsite personnel attempted to steer the well-bore
down to the low gamma portion of the drilling zone to attempt to establish dip. After multiple
encounters with tight streaks which moved the well-bore’s inclination above 90 degrees the
directional drillers were able to position the well-bore in the lower gamma area of the drilling
zone. At this point the target zone was revised to an 8 foot drilling zone located sixteen feet into
the Three Forks Formation. The revised plan was implemented to avoid deflections from
multiple tight streaks located high in formation, and to take advantage of the low gamma
primarily dolomitic facies which proved useful for steering decisions. Steering decisions from
this point were made by using the higher gamma, of the claystone, the low gamma located in the
middle to higher portion of the drilling zone, and the fluctuating high to medium gamma located
at the top of the drilling zone.

At 20,573’ MD while taking a check shot to determine the well-bore inclination, spiking
differential pressure shut down the pumps. It was determined that the well-bore had entered the
pronghorn formation at 20,530’ MD, which was causing the hole to pack off. Working the pipe
and pumping cleared the hole enough to take a survey at 20,573’ MD with a survey depth of
20,520’, which showed an inclination of 91.5°. A previous check shot at 20,535’ MD and a
survey depth of 20,482’ showed an inclination of 90.5°; a difference of 1° change in inclination
over 38’ while rotating. This illustrates one of the problems encountered in the later portion of
the lateral. Despite multiple down side slides, the well-bore showed a persistent tendency to
build rapidly on rotation. Onsite personnel at this time were plotting the formation inclination at
0.61° up, which had been recently revised from a 1.12° up dip. The data from the pronghorn
strike when plotted with previous data determined that the formation had unexpectedly rolled
over to a dip of 0.01. This unexpected dip change combined with the well-bores tendency to
build on rotation, and the difficulty in sliding, and obtaining effective slides all contributed to the
pronghorn strike.

Samples tended to contain a greater quantity of the tan to cream, rare off white dolomite where
gamma values were lower, and relatively a greater quantity of the blue green gray shale where
gamma values were higher. Samples from the claystone contained a dolomite mudstone, which
was gray, tan to cream, with a trace of light gray, and a trace of off white. It was very fine
crystalline, friable, dense, with an earthy texture. Minerals present were rare disseminated pyrite,
along with a trace of nodular pyrite. Also noted was possible intercrystalline porosity, and
common spotty light to medium brown oil stain. Also present in samples taken from the higher
gamma claystone facies was shale. This shale was a light gray green to light gray, pale green
with a trace off white. This shale was firm, subblocky, with an earthy texture, along with a trace
disseminated pyrite. No visible oil stain was noted in the observed shale. Where the low gamma
was encountered in the bottom of the target interval, thin layers of dolomite contained possible
fair to good intercrystalline porosity and common spotty light to medium brown oil staining.

The TD of 21,450’ MD was achieved at 1550 hours CDT on July 16, 2013. The well site team
worked well together maintaining the well bore in the desired target interval for 88% of the
lateral, opening 10,225’ of potentially productive reservoir rock. The hole was then circulated
and reamed for completion.

LITHOLOGY

Rig crews caught lagged samples, under the supervision of Sunburst geologists, in 30’ intervals
from 8,240’ to 11,000’, 10’ intervals from 11,000’ to 11,170’and then 30’ intervals from 11,170’
to the TD of 21,220’. Sample or gamma ray marker tops have been inserted in the sample
descriptions below for reference. Samples were examined wet and dry under a binocular
microscope.

Oasis Petroleum is respectfully seeking permission to make fhe follow amendment to our well design on the Yukon

24-HOUR PRODUCTION RATE

Run two open hole swell packers directly outside of the 7" casing shoe, and a single open hole swell packer directly
inside of the 7" casing, below the perforations. Perforations in our 4.5" liner for the purpose of fracture stimulation
and production will be below the prior mentioned swell packers. —~ ‘Je, } ao P act HTH Su 7

The reason for the change request is that circulation was lost after getting 7" casing to TD, in the Three Forks
formation._Permission.was_ granted by JohpAxtmanto-perferate 7” casing in the Middle Bakken with 8 x 1/2" holes
at a depth of 10,820" MD (10,739' TVD). The 7" casing shoe is at 11,125" MD (476" south of the SHL). The 200° hardline
is 455° south of SHL. The perforations shot at 10,820' MD are 207' south of SHL (7' FNL). The 7" casing shoe is
across the hardline, but the perforations are not.

As a result of the likely case that there is not sufficient cement isolation across the hardline, Oasis Petroleum is
respectfully requesting permission to use the swellable packer configuration described above in order to achieve
isolation prior to fracture stimulation. ——~ h\ nied i Se i

Mike:
Oasis will need to plan for cement isolation on the 4.5” liner since perfs are at 48’ from the south line
(outside the spacing unit). Please submit a plan ona Form 4 accordingly and include a schematic.

Option #1: Cement entire 4.5” liner from TD to liner top
Option #2: Cement from port on 4.5” liner (needs to be 200’ past 7” casing point=>676 S) to top of liner.

Either option will require a CBL to be run across the hardline and back up into 7”.
Thanks,

Todd

Mike:
Oasis will need to plan for cement isolation on the 4.5” liner since perfs are at 48’ from the south line
(outside the spacing unit). Please submit a plan on a Form 4 accordingly and include a schematic.

Option #1: Cement entire 4.5” liner from TD to liner top
Option #2: Cement from port on 4.5” liner (needs to be 200’ past 7” casing point=>676 S) to top of finer.

Either option will require a CBL to be run across the hardline and back up into 7”,
Thanks,

Todd

24-HOUR PRODUCTION RATE

Run two open hole swell packers directly outside of the 7" casing shoe, and a single open hole swell packer directly
inside of the 7" casing, below the perforations. Perforations in our 4.5" liner for the purpose of fracture stimulation
and production will be below the prior mentioned swell packers. a enw} ao p art HTS Su .

The reason for the change request is that circulation was lost after getting 7" casing to TD, in the Three Forks
formation,_Permisslon.was granted by John dximanto-porferate 7” casing in the Middle Bakken with 8 x 1/2" holes
at a depth of 10,820" MD (10,739" TVD). The 7" casing shoe is at 11,125" MD (476" south of the SHL). The 200° hardline

"~| is 455" south of SHL. The perforations shot at 10,820" MD are 207' south of SHL (7' FNL). The 7" casing shoe is

across the hardline, but the perforations are not.
As a result of the likely case that there is not sufflclent cement Isolation across the hardline, Oasis Petroleum is

respectfully requesting permission to use the swellable packer configuration described above in order to achieve
isolation prior to fracture stimulation. —— \ 4 2 rsel at

Oasis Petroleum North America LLC has a 52.84% working interest in the Daphne 5301

Catch Federal 5201 11-12H. We anticipate rig release on December 22, 2011. The rig is
scheduled to move on to the Achilles next. We have construction crews ready and
waiting for approval to build. Waiting three business days prior to commencing
construction on the location may cause a delay in rig mobilization operations. This will
cause a delay in scheduling future operations and will also create a financial burden for
Oasis. Due to some Jast minute scheduling conflicts, we do not have a backup location
built to allow this rig to move rather than wait. We respectfully ask permission to begin
location construction upon approval of the permit.

Survey Requirements for Horizontal, Horizontal Re-entry, and Directional Wells

NDAC Section 43-02-03-25 (Deviation Tests and Directional Surveys) states in part (that) the survey contractor
shall file a certified copy of all surveys with the director free of charge within thirty days of completion. Surveys
must be submitted as one electronic copy, or in a form approved by the director. However, the director may
require the directional survey to be filed immediately after completion if the survey is needed to conduct the
operation of the director's office in a timely manner. Certified surveys must be submitted via email in one adobe

document, with a certification cover page to certsurvey@nd.gov.

Survey points shall be of such frequency to accurately determine the entire location of the well bore.

Reserve pit
Please be advised that conditions may be imposed on the use and reclamation of a drilling reserve pit on
this site if specific site conditions warrant.

Surface casing cement

Tail cement utilized on surface casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi within 12
hours, and tail cement utilized on production casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi
before drilling the plug or initiating tests.

Logs

NDAC Section 43-02-03-31 requires the running of a Cement Bond Log from which the presence of
cement can be determined in every well in which production or intermediate casing has been set and a Gamma
Ray Log must be run from total depth to ground level elevation of the well bore. All logs must be submitted as
one paper copy and one digital copy in LAS (Log ASCII) format, or a format approved by the Director. Image
logs that include, but are not limited to, Mud Logs, Cement Bond Logs, and Cyberlook Logs, cannot be produced
in their entirety as LAS (Log ASCI)) files. To create a solution and establish a standard format for industry to
follow when submitting image logs, the Director has given approval for the operator to submit an image log as a
TIFF (*.tif) formatted file. The TIFF (*.tif) format will be accepted only when the log cannot be produced in its
entirety as a LAS (Log ASCII) file format. The digital copy may be submitted on a 3.5” floppy diskette, a standard
CD, or attached to an email sent to digitallogs@nd.gov
Thank you for your cooperation.

SWSW Section 12-153N-101W
McKenzie County
Well File # 22099
Dear Kaitlin :

Pursuant to Commission Order No. 18012, approval to drill the above captioned well is hereby given. The
approval is granted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than
the 200' setback from the north & south boundaries and 500' setback from the east & west boundaries within
the 1280 acre spacing unit consisting of Sections 1 & 12. Tool error is not required pursuant to order

PERMIT STIPULATIONS: A Closed Mud System is required on multi-well pads, although the disposal
of drill cuttings is contingent upon site specific conditions to be determined by an NDIC Field
Inspector. A perimeter dike is required along the north & east sides of the location. OASIS must
contact NDIC Field Inspector Marc Binns at 701-220-5989 prior to location construction.

Form 1 Changes & Hard Lines
Any changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC.
The proposed directional plan is at a legal location. The maximum legal coordinate from the well head at casing

point is: 150W. Also, based on the azimuth of the proposed lateral the maximum legal coordinate from the well
head is: 9952S & 150W.

Location Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period)

Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the
approved drilling permit on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report. If circumstances require operations to
commence before the 3rd business day following publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may
be waived by the Director. Application for a waiver must be by sworn affidavit providing the information
necessary to evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(, and any other
information that would allow the Director to conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the
drilling permit, the applicant should retain the permit.

Permit Fee & Notification

Payment was received in the amount of $100 via credit card .The permit fee has been received. It is requested
that notification be given immediately upon the spudding of the well. This information should be relayed to the
Oil & Gas Division, Bismarck, via telephone. The following information must be included: Well name, legal

NOTE: A Gamma Ray log must be run to ground surface and a CBL must be run on intermediate or longstring casing string if set.

NOTE: Intermediate or longstring casing string must be cemented above the top Dakota Group Sand.

Surveys are required at least every 30 feet in the build section and every 90 feet in the lateral section of a horizontal well. Measurement
inaccuracies are not considered when determining compliance with the spacing/drilling unit boundary setback requirement except in the
following scenarios: 1) When the angle between the well bore and the respective boundary is 10 degrees or less; or 2) If Industry standard
methods and equipment are not utilized. Consult the applicable field order for exceptions.

If measurement inaccuracies are required to be considered, a 2° MWD measurement inaccuracy will be applied to the horizontal portion of the well
bore. This measurement inaccuracy is applied to the well bore from KOP to TD.

REQUIRED ATTACHMENTS: Certified surveyor's plat, horizontal section plat, estimated geological tops, proposed mud/cementing plan,
directional plot/plan, $100 fee.
