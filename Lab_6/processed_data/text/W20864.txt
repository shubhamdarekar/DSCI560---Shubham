WELL EVALUATION

Xtreme Coil Rig 17 drilling for Oasis Petroleum North America in North Dakota during 2011.
(Nathan Gabelman, well site geologist for Sunburst Consulting)

INTRODUCTION

The Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC Bray 5301 43-12H [SW SE Section 12 T153N
R101W] is located approximately 4 miles south of Williston in McKenzie County, North
Dakota. The well is part of Oasis Petroleum’s Williston Basin drilling program, targeting the
Middle Bakken with two section laterals and utilizing the latest technology in fracture
stimulation completions. The well was permitted for a 10,086’ lateral drilling south 1,927’ from
the east line of sections 12, 13 and 24. Directional tools will kick-off from the vertical hole in the
Lodgepole Formation, build a curve and land in the Middle Bakken target zone. The proposed
lateral would be geo-steered within the ideal target rock, focusing on a higher porosity zone
approximately 8 feet from the bottom of the Upper Bakken Shale. The lateral will be directed
along an azimuth of 180° to a TD approximately 200’ from the south line in the SW 4 of SE
Section 24.

Lithology and Hydrocarbon Shows

Geologic evaluation began at 8,240’ in orange to orange brown siltstone with trace amount of
white to off white sandstone in the Kibbey Formation. The Kibbey “Lime” was drilled at 8,355’
(-6,261’), coming in 3’ low to Lindvig 1-11HR and was determined based off a decrease in rate
of penetration (ROP), due to a 16’ layer of anhydrite. Samples from this interval are mostly light
gray to brown lime mudstone with a crystalline texture. Below the Kibbey “Lime” marker
samples consist of orange brown to brown calcareous siltstone. No significant shows were
observed in the Kibbey.

Figure 1: Photograph of limestone from Kibbey Formation.

The First Charles Salt was penetrated at 8,494’ (-6,400’) and came in even to Lindvig I-11HR,
based off ROP breaks. The Base of the Last Charles Salt was drilled at 9,198’ (-7,104’), 1’ high
to Lindvig 1-11HR. Samples from this interval were primarily salt which was translucent to a
milky white color and typically consisting of firm to hard subhedral crystals, inter-bedded with
argillaceous limestone and anhydrite. The lime mudstone was firm to friable, crystalline and
primarily light to medium gray to gray-brown in color. The anhydrite was white, soft, and
amorphous in texture.

OFFSET INFORMATION

Three previously completed wells were used as the main offsets to assist in landing the curve
build section of the Bray 5301 43-12H. The Lindvig 1-11H, initially completed as a vertical well,
was drilled on December |2, 1981 and was then re-entered on February 17, 2008 and completed
as a horizontal well, located approximately 0.80 miles west of Bray 5301 43-12H in [Sec. 11,
TIS3N, RIOIW]. The Lindvig 1-11HR was initially drilled to produce both the Red River
Formation (dry to date) and the Madison Group (producing 201,159 Bbls of oil to date). Lindvig
1-11HR was then re-entered and completed as a single section lateral, to focus production in the
Mississippian Nesson interval (approximately -7,321’ subsea). The initial completion of the
lateral showed an increase in production from approximately 200 Bbls of oil a month to 1,600
Bbls of oil a month, which has since tapered off to 400 Bbls of oil a month as of August, 2011.
The SM Energy Company Rosebud 22-11 [Sec. 11, T153N, R101 W] is a vertical well targeting
the Red River Formation (199,061 Bbls of oil). This well was drilled on September 21, 1985 and
is located 1.45 miles northwest of Bray 5301 43-12H. The third offset well is the Earthstone
Energy Edwin M. Dahl 23-1, which is a vertical well targeting the Red River Formation
(producing 26,011 Bbls of oil to date) and the Madison Group (producing 113,393 Bbls of oil to
date). Edwin M. Dahl 23-1 was drilled on June 29, 1980 and is located 2.50 miles southwest of
Bray 5301 43-12H in Section 23. The gamma ray signatures through the lower Lodgepole and
Bakken observed in the SM Energy Company Lindvig 1-11HR provided the best correlation with
the MWD gamma ray observed during operations, and provided formation thicknesses consistent
with what was observed on Bray 5301 43-12H. Complete tops data are included as an appendix
to this report.

ENGINEERING

Professional Directional LTD, provided equipment and personnel for measurement-while-
drilling (MWD) and directional drilling services. Sunburst Consulting geologists worked closely
throughout the project with Professional Directional personnel to make steering decisions to
maximize the amount of borehole in the pay zone

Spud

The Bray 5301 43-12H was initially spud on July 24, 2011, with a Reed 13 %” tri-cone surface
bit (bit #1). Bit #1 was used to drill the surface hole with fresh water and drilled 2,040’ in 49
hours, reaching the initial surface casing depth on July 25, 2011. The hole was then sealed to be
re-entered on August 27, 2011.

Re-Entry: Vertical

Bray 5301 43-12H was then re-entered on August 27, 2011 with a Security 8 %4” PDC bit (bit
#2). Bit #2 was used to drill out of surface casing with a |.50° Hunting LS fixed motor in invert
drilling fluid with a weight between 9.5-9.7 pound per gallon (ppg), with 5” drill pipe. This
assembly drilled 8,080’ in 79.5 hours to kick-off point (KOP) at 10,220’ MD, and then was
tripped out on September 02, 2011 to be replaced with the curve assembly.

The Ratcliffe Interval was penetrated at 9,230’ (-7,136’), 1’ high to Lindvig 1-1/HR. This
formation consists of dolomitic mudstone, anhydrite, and limestone that were argillaceous in
sections. The observed tan, light to medium gray brown dolomite was microcrystalline, firm, and
contained a chalky to earthy texture. The anhydrite was a white to off white color, with a
microcrystalline texture, and was soft and amorphous. The tan, light to medium gray brown
argillaceous lime mudstone-wackestone described was microcrystalline, firm, with an earthy
textured and exhibited no visible porosity. This section can contain a significant amount of oil
and gas, and was particularly productive in the offset well Lindvig 1-1/HR. The cuttings and
mud gas analysis by a total gas chromatograph, however, did not log productive shows suspected
over this interval. These shows, however, were present within the lower unit of the Mississippian
Madison Group, the Mission Canyon Formation.

The Mission Canyon Formation [Mississippian Madison Group] was penetrated at 9,416’
(-7,322’), 5’ high to Lindvig 1-11HR. This formation consists predominately of limestone with
poor intercrystalline porosity and an earthy texture. The lime mudstone was typically medium to
dark gray, microcrystalline, firm and contained sections that were partially argillaceous. Traces
of anhydrite were also observed, that were white to off white, soft and amorphous. There was
trace spotty dark brown oil staining observed in cuttings, which was highlighted by a gas show
of 107 units, present in the limestone unit.

Figure 3: Photograph of anhydrite and limestone from the Mission Canyon Formation.

The Lodgepole Formation [Mississippian Madison Group] was drilled at 9,978’ (-7,884’), 3°
high to Lindvig 1-11HR. The Lodgepole contains some limestone near the top of the formation,
but was dominated primarily by an argillaceous lime mudstone with common traces of pyrite.
The limestone samples are tan, light gray to cream, microcrystalline, earthy texture, and friable

to firm with no visible porosity or oil show.

Curve

Curve building started September 03, 2011 at 10,220’ MD (KOP). Diesel invert drilling fluid
fluctuated in density between 10.48 and 10.6 ppg. The curve bottom hole assembly (BHA)
consisted of a Security 8 %” bit (bit #3) and a 2.5° Professional Direction LS fixed mud motor.
The BHA also included a Professional Directional MWD tool that recorded survey and gamma
ray data. This assembly drilled the entire curve of 862’ in 13 hours, achieving exceptional build
rates and landing the curve 12 feet into the Middle Bakken Member, reaching the curve TD of
11,082’ MD (10,734’ TVD). The drill string and BHA were tripped out of the hole while laying
down the 5” drill pipe using a lay-down crew. Casing operations were performed by Wyoming
Casing Services Inc. The 7” intermediate casing consisted of 182 joints of 29# HCP-110 and 64
joints of 32# HCP-110 set to 11,071’ MD. Cementing operations were then performed by
Schlumberger.

Lateral

After intermediate casing procedures were completed, 4” drill pipe was picked up, diesel invert
drilling fluid was replaced with salt water drilling fluid which fluctuated in density from 10.2-
10.6 ppg throughout the lateral. The first lateral BHA consisted of a 6” Smith PDC bit (bit #4),
with a Hunting LS 1.5 degree bend motor and a gamma tool 37’ from the bit. This assembly
drilled to 15,562’ MD in 55 hours before a trip was required to replace the motor. The next
assembly consisted of a 6” Smith PDC bit (bit #4); with a Hunting LS 1.5 degree bend motor and
a gamma tool 37’ from the bit. This final BHA reached TD at 20,978’ taking 76 hours. The
wellbore reached a planned total depth (TD) on October 22, 2011 at 1230 CDT, with a bottom
hole location at 10,478.70' south & 2.05' east of surface location or approximately 308.07' FSL
& 1,924.95' FEL, SW SE Section 24, T153N, RIOIW.

Two well-site geologists contracted by Sunburst Consulting Inc. conducted the geologic analysis
for Bray 5301 43-12H. Sunburst installed and monitored a digital gas detector and
chromatograph interfaced with a Pason Electronic Data Recording System (EDR). The EDR
provided depth, drilling rate and pump stroke data to the M-Controller gas-monitoring software
which returned gas data in the form of total gas units and hydrocarbon constituent (methane,
ethane, propane, butane) concentrations expressed in parts-per-million. Gas samples were pulled
through '4” poly-flow tubing after agitation in Sunburst’s gas trap installed in the possum belly.
Rig crews caught lagged samples under the supervision of well-site geologists in 30’ intervals
from 8,240’ to 10,880’; 10° intervals from 10,880’ to 11,090’; 30° intervals from 11,090’ to
20,960’. Wet and dry cuttings were examined under a binocular microscope, complete lithologic
descriptions are provided in this evaluation. Cuttings were also evaluated for hydrocarbon “cut”
by immersion in Entron and inspected under a UV fluoroscope until samples became
contaminated with lateral lubricant at approximately 15,300’ MD. One set of dry cuttings were
collected and sent to the North Dakota Geological Survey Core Library.

The “False Bakken” was penetrated at 10,692’ TVD (-8,598’), 3’ low to Lindvig 1-11 HR. The
False Bakken in this area is particularly thin, and was not observed in the cuttings. The False
Bakken consists of very dark gray carbonaceous shale. Fracture porosity was observed though,
present ina gas spike of up to 4000 units, which is typical of the False Bakken.

The Upper Bakken Shale was drilled at 10,703’ TVD (-8,609’), 6’ low to Lindvig 1-11HR.
Sample returns were black, carbonaceous and petroliferous shale with common disseminated
O pyrite and characterized by gamma ray values in excess of 300 API counts.

Figure 6: Photograph of sample from the target zone of the Middle Bakken.

The target zone within the Middle Bakken was determined during a casing point meeting prior
to horizontal drilling operations. The desired target zone was primarily chosen off of data
provided by the Lindvig /-11HR offset log. The 12’ interval shaded in red and yellow in Figure
7; set 8’ below the base of the Upper Bakken Shale and the base set at ~14’ above the top of the
Lower Bakken Shale, was defined as the primary target interval. Within the 12’ target zone,
drilling was focused on the two high gamma spike (112-120 API) right at the top of target, for
geo-steering purposes, and this gamma marked an eight foot high porosity zone at the top of

target labeled and shaded in yellow in Figure 7. The eight foot zone was distinguishable in
O cuttings as silty sandstone, having moderate calcite cement, abundant in light to medium brown
color, spotty to even brown oil staining and occasional light to medium gray color. Directly
below this zone was well cemented light gray to medium gray silty sandstone, which showed
occasional spotty brown oil staining. Above the eight foot high porosity zone consisted of
moderately cemented medium to light gray silty sandstone occasional medium to light brown
and common dark gray in color, with occasional spotty brown oil staining.

Rate of penetration in the targeted Middle Bakken averaged 100-150 ft/hr while drilling early in
the lateral. For the latter half of the lateral, rates dropped to 80-100 ft/hr due to motor and bit
wear. In the later half, however, an increase in rate of penetration was witnessed at 19,400’

Geo-steering

The target zone within the Bakken Middle Member was established using the density porosity
logs from the aforementioned offset wells. A 12’ zone in the Lindvig /-11HR offset well set the
basis for the choice of target interval in the Bray 5301 43-12H project (Figure 7). This 12’
section was 8’ below the base of the Upper Bakken Shale and 16’ above the Lower Bakken
Shale. The target displayed two peaks of high gamma (112-120 API), one at the center of target,
the other at the top of target. Low gamma points that established points just below the center of
target and bottom of the target zone. Within the 12’ zone, particular efforts were made to stay in
the top eight feet of the target zone which correlated to the high porosity displayed in the Lindvig
1-11HR electric logs. The well plan was to land in the center of the Middle Bakken target
interval to allow maximum exposure to the target porosity. To accommodate the planned liner
run, severe doglegs were to be avoided to obtain the desired vertical section.

Kick off point for the curve was changed to 10,220’ based off the observed thickness to target
from the Base Last Salt marker. The represented targets are below in Table |. At this point the
Base Last Salt was the most consistent marker throughout the offset wells, allowing for a raise of
the target depth approximately 8 feet. This changed the proposed target landing to 10,724’ TVD,
which remained consistent throughout the vertical hole. Throughout the curve the target
approximation remained overly consistent, but began to drop as lower Lodgepole markers were
logged. As the lower Lodgepole markers were observed the target landing was moved to 10,730”
TVD to account for this thickening to target. Once the Upper Bakken Shale top was reached, the
landing point was one foot lower to the initial prognosis. The target landing point was then
change back to its initial prognosis of 10,732’ TVD, allowing for the curve build to safely land
the borehole into the Middle Bakken Member, at approximately 90 degrees to begin the lateral.

Figure 8: Chromatography of Bray 5301 43-12H gas show at 15,561’ MD during tripping operations.

A chromatograph separated the total gas into prospective components, as displayed in Figure 8,
showing a larger concentration of normal butane relative to iso-butane, which is typical for
Bakken crude associated gas. Background gas concentrations observed in the Middle Bakken
lateral ranged from approximately 600 units during the curve and at the beginning of lateral with
a 10.0 ppg mud weight with shows in the mid 2,500 units. Towards the end of the lateral
background gas increased to an excess of 3,000 units with shows in excess of 5,000 units with a
10.8 ppg mud weight. Increased background gas concentrations were witnessed during intervals
of high apparent formation dips. These intervals of high dips were between 13,950’ MD and
14,350’ MD where the dip averaged 0.8 degrees down and then again between 15,750’ MD and
20,975’ MD where the dip averaged 1.0 degrees up. This increase in gas is likely due to
increased fracture porosity, caused by fracturing within the rock from the strain caused by these
deformations or a local structural trap. The highest peak value observed was nearly 7,144 units
at 20,673’ MD with a mud weight of 10.5 ppg. Connection gases within the target zone
averaged ~1,500-2,000 units in the beginning of the lateral to ~4,000-6,000 units towards the
| end. Greenish brown oil was observed coming over the shakers and within the sample cuttings
throughout the entire lateral. When sample cuttings were submerged in Entron, they emitted a
| slow to very slow diffuse green fluorescence. Entron submersion was then halted once samples
became contaminated with lube. Throughout the lateral a 1-8’ intermittent flare was observed,
O and at points could reach up to 25’, as portrayed in Figure 9.

SUMMARY

|) The Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC Bray 5301 43-12H was drilled to further
develop the Middle Bakken in the northern McKenzie County portion of the Williston
Basin.

2) The well was re-entered on August 27, 2011 and the vertical hole was drilled to a kick-
off point of 10,220’. The well path landed below the Middle Bakken porosity zone at
10,733’ TVD. Intermediate casing was set at 11,082’ MD in preparation for lateral
operations. Lateral operations progressed within the Middle Bakken, with very good
hydrocarbon shows to the final bottom hole location when drilling was completed on
October 22, 2011.

3) The mud program consisted of diesel invert (9.6 — 9.8 ppg) from surface casing and
through the curve build, which was successful in maintaining stable hole conditions and
minimizing washout through the salt intervals. After landing the curve the diesel invert
mud was replaced with salt brine (10.2 - 10.6 ppg) and was successful in preventing loss
of pore pressure throughout the lateral.

4) The lithology of the Middle Bakken target zone is off white to light brown and gray, very
fine grained sandstone and siltstone with poor to fair intergranular porosity and common
to occasional spotty to even brown oil stain. Gas was burned as a 1-8’ intermittent flare
while circulating higher show areas of the formation.

5) The Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC Bray 5301 43-12H reached 20,978’ TD on
October 22, 2011, reaching the proposed TD. The well currently awaits completion as
successful Middle Bakken horizontal oil well.

Table 1. Chart used to determine landing target based on formation thicknesses in the offset wells.

The wellbore landed at a casing point of 11,082’ MD (10,733’ TVD); approximately 14” TVD
into the Middle Bakken Member and 6’ into the target zone. Upon drilling out of casing, build
tendencies were observed, in that the well bore would build up in rotation, approximately one
degree per a hundred feet. Slides were implemented to account for this continuous rotational
building. Once out of the casing an inclination of 87.7 was accurately determined by the MWD
tool to replace the initial projected inclination of 90 degrees. The lateral assembly was then
leveled out to slowly drop in target to obtain the full gamma signature of the targeted zone. By
using the cool gamma and hot gamma near the center of target the dip was able to be calculated,
and was found to be an overall down dip of approximately 0.5 degrees. By steering the well bore
up and down through this sequence of hot and cold gamma signatures multiple times, reliable dip
calculations were established until 14,250’ MD. After 14,250’ MD the dip of formation turned
up placing the wellbore near the base of target. In this stratigraphic section there is a low gamma
marker at the base of target followed by ratty high gamma above and below the low gamma
marker. Using this sequence of gamma markers the well bore was steered within target to
19,477’ MD, which showed an overall dip of formation of over 1.0 degrees up. At this point the
wellbore ascended back up to the center of target where it was steered, using the hot gamma
marker at the center of target, to a total depth of 20,978’. Over the entire vertical section of
10,479’ the overall dip of formation was calculate to be 0.39 degrees up, with the well bore over
90 percent within the target interval, and 50 percent of the time the well bore was steered within
the ideal porosity zone.

DETAILS OF WORK
We respectfully request permission to suspend drilling operations for the subject well. Oasis intends to have XTC-17
drill the 8-3/4" hole and run and cement 7" casing. While waiting on cement, we will skid the rig 100' to the east onto
the Foley Federal 5301 43-12H with 5" drill pipe in the derrick to begin drilling operations in the 8-3/4" hole for this
well. Once we run and cement the 7" casing, we will continue with operations and drill our 6" lateral to TD. We will
run our liner and packers and finish operations on the Foley Federal 5301 43-12H before skidding back to the Bray
5301 43-12H to do the same. This method of drilling will save Oasis several days of rig time which results in cost
savings for our operations.

Survey Requirements for Horizontal, Horizontal Re-entry, and Directional Wells

NDAC Section 43-02-03-25 (Deviation Tests and Directional Surveys) states in part (that) the survey contractor
shall file a certified copy of all surveys with the director free of charge within thirty days of completion. Surveys
must be submitted as one electronic copy, or in a form approved by the director. However, the director may
require the directional survey to be filed immediately after completion if the survey is needed to conduct the
operation of the director's office in a timely manner. Certified surveys must be submitted via email in one adobe
document, with a certification cover page to certsurvey@nd.gov.

Survey points shall be of such frequency to accurately determine the entire location of the well bore.

Reserve pit
Please be advised that conditions may be imposed on the use and reclamation of a drilling reserve pit on
this site if specific site conditions warrant.

Surface casing cement

Tail cement utilized on surface casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi within 12
hours, and tail cement utilized on production casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi
before drilling the plug or initiating tests.

Logs

NDAC Section 43-02-03-31 requires the running of a Cement Bond Log from which the presence of
cement can be determined in every well in which production or intermediate casing has been set and a Gamma
Ray Log must be run from total depth to ground level elevation of the well bore. All logs must be submitted as
one paper copy and one digital copy in LAS (Log ASCII) format, or a format approved by the Director. Image
logs that include, but are not limited to, Mud Logs, Cement Bond Logs, and Cyberlook Logs, cannot be produced
in their entirety as LAS (Log ASCI)) files. To create a solution and establish a standard format for industry to
follow when submitting image logs, the Director has given approval for the operator to submit an image log as a
TIFF (*.tif) formatted file. The TIFF (*.tif) format will be accepted only when the log cannot be produced in its
entirety as a LAS (Log ASCII) file format. The digital copy may be submitted on a 3.5” floppy diskette, a standard
CD, or attached to an email sent to digitallogs@nd.gov

Thank you for your cooperation.

RE: HORIZONTAL WELL
BRAY 5301 43-12H
SWSE Section 12-153N-101W
McKenzieCounty
Well File # 20864

Dear Brandi :

Pursuant to Commission Order No. 14007, approval to drill the above captioned well is hereby given. The
approval is granted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than
the 200' setback (per ICO 14498) from the north & south boundaries and 1220' setback (per Commission policy)
from the east & west boundaries within the 1280 acre drilling unit consisting of Section 13 & 24 T153N R101W.

PERMIT STIPULATIONS: A Closed Mud System is required on multi-well pads, although the disposal
of drill cuttings is contingent upon site specific conditions to be determined by an NDIC Field
Inspector. In cases where a spacing unit is accessed from an off-site drill pad, an affidavit must be
provided affirming that the surface owner of the multi-well pad agrees to accept burial on their property
of the cuttings generated from drilling the well(s) into an offsite spacing/drilling unit. OASIS PETRO
NO AMER must contact NDIC Field Inspector Kevin Connors at 701-220-5989 prior to location
construction. OASIS PETROLEUM NORTH AMERICA LLC must ensure the pit is not constructed
in fill dirt.

Location Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period)

Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the
approved drilling permit on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report. If circumstances require operations to
commence before the 3rd business day following publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may
be waived by the Director. Application for a waiver must be by sworn affidavit providing the information
necessary to evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f), and any other
information that would allow the Director to conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the
drilling permit, the applicant should retain the permit.

Permit Fee & Notification

Payment was received in the amount of $100 via credit card .The permit fee has been received. It is requested
that notification be given immediately upon the spudding of the well. This information should be relayed to the
Oil & Gas Division, Bismarck, via telephone. The following information must be included: Well name, legal
location, permit number, drilling contractor, company representative, date and time of spudding. Office hours are
8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. Central Time. Our telephone number is (701) 328-8020, leave a
message if after hours or on the weekend.

DETAILS OF WORK
Oasis requests permission for suspension of drilling for up to 90 days for the referenced well under NDAC 43-02-03-
55. Oasis intends to drill the surface hole with freshwater based drilling mud and set surface casing with a small
drilling rig and move off within 3 to 5 days. The casing will be set at a depth pre-approved by the NDIC per the
Application for Permit to Drill NDAC 43-02-03-21. No saltwater will be used in the drilling and cementing operations of
the surface casing. Once the surface casing is cemented, a plug or mechanical seal will be placed at the top of the
casing to prevent any foreign matter from getting into the well. A rig capable of drilling to TD will move onto the
location within the 90 days previously outlined to complete the drilling and casing plan as per the APD. The
undersigned states that this request for suspension of drilling operations in accordance with the Subsection 4 of
Section 43-02-03-55 of the NDAC, is being requested to take advantage of the cost savings and time savings of using
an initial rig that is smaller than the rig necessary to drill a well to total depth but is not intended to alter or extend the
terms and conditions of, or suspend any obligation under, any oil and gas lease with acreage in or under the spacing
or drilling unit for the above-referenced well. Oasis understands NDAC 43-02-03-31 requirements regarding
confidentiality pertaining to this permit. The lined reserve pit will be fenced immediately after construction if the well
pad is located in a pasture (NDAC 43-02-03-19 & 19.1). Oasis will plug and abandon the well and reclaim the well site if
the well is not drilled by the larger rotary rig within 90 days after spudding the well with the smaller drilling rig.

Surveys are required at least every 30 feet in the build section and every 90 feet in the lateral section of a horizontal well. Measurement
inaccuracies are not considered when determining compliance with the spacing/drilling unit boundary setback requirement except in the
following scenarios: 1) When the angle between the well bore and the respective boundary is 10 degrees or less; or 2) If Industry standard
methods and equipment are not utilized. Consult the applicable field order for exceptions.

If measurement inaccuracies are required to be considered, a 2° MWD measurement inaccuracy will be applied to the horizontal portion of the well
bore. This measurement inaccuracy is applied to the well bore from KOP to TD.

REQUIRED ATTACHMENTS: Certified surveyor's plat, horizontal section plat, estimated geological tops, proposed mud/cementing plan,
