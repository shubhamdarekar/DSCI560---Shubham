INTRODUCTION

The Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC - Wade Federal 5300 21-30 13B well [Lot 2 Section
30, T153N, R1O0W] is located approximately 31 miles south of Williston, North Dakota (Figure
1). The well was spud on October 26, 2014 by Nabors rig B25, and represents a continuation of
Oasis Petroleum’s development of the Middle Bakken and Three Forks within Baker Field. The
well was planned to drill an approximately 9,623’ long lateral, along a proposed azimuth of
85.39°. Upon completion of drilling operations, the well will be enhanced for production by a
multistage fracture stimulation.

Geo-steering:

Kick-off point was established from the isopach of the “base last salt” marker to the Three
Forks “target” from the offset wells. While drilling the curve, measured gamma signatures
were compared to those of the three offsets and aided in the landing of the curve. The landing
target was confirmed by the depth of the False Bakken, which was consistent with the offset
wells. The curve successfully landed within the Middle Bakken Member at a depth of
11,050’ MD (10,660’ TVD). Directional tools were then pulled out of the hole and a string
of 7” casing was set to 11,006’ MD and then cemented by Schlumberger.

Samples from the target zone varied in porosity, oil staining, color, cementation, and pyrite
content. Stratigraphic location in the target zone was based on these sample observations
along with gas shows, drill rates and gamma ray values.

The Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC prospect geologist defined the target zone as a 10”
zone that began 15’ below the upper shale and ended 15 feet above the lower shale. The
target zone consisted of an upper silty sandstone interval, reading gamma from 115-120
counts (A marker). The center of the target interval was comprised of a lighter colored silty
sandstone, with a higher gamma signature ranging between 120 and 130 counts (B marker).
The base of the target zone was characterized as a clean, silty sandstone with gamma ranging
from 70 to 110 counts (C marker). A-C gamma markers were used for determining depth
within the target interval (Figure 7).

OFFSET CONTROL INFORMATION

Three offsets were used to establish a prognosis of formation tops and thicknesses to be used as a
control for the Wade Federal 5300 21-30 13B (Figure 2). Offset formation thicknesses were
compared and an appropriate curve landing target was selected based on the average of these
thicknesses. Structural data was also used during the lateral. The three offsets include the Wade
Federal 5300 21-30 12T which was spud on September 30", 2014, is located on the same pad as
the subject well and was considered the primary offset. The Chalmers 5301 44-24 2TR was spud
on the June 11", 2014 and is located 0.50 miles north of the subject well. The Wade Federal
5300 21-30 14T2 was spud on September 28", 2014 and is located on the same pad as the
subject well.

GEOLOGIC EVALUATION
Methods:

Geologic supervision was provided by Sunburst Consulting, Inc. with two pairs of well-site
geologists. A digital gas detector and chromatograph were interfaced with a Pason electronic
data recorder system (EDR). The unit of measure for gas on this well was units, which was
defined as 100 units equaling 1% methane equivalent in air. The EDR provided drill rate, on-
off bottom and pump strokes to the gas detection computer and received total gas
information from Sunburst for viewing around location. Lagged samples were caught by the
rig crew in 30’ intervals from 8,200’ to 10,810’ MD, 10’ intervals from 10,810’ to 11,050’
MD, and 30’ intervals from 11,050’ to 20,560’ MD. Wet and dry cuttings were examined
under a bi-ocular microscope and complete lithologic descriptions and sampling intervals are
provided in the lithology document within this evaluation. The set of dry cuttings collected
during the duration of the well were sent to the State of North Dakota.

Zones of Interest:

The Mission Canyon Formation was drilled at 9,331’ TVD (-7,307’) and is comprised
largely of light gray, lime mudstone followed by gray to tan, earthy textured, argillaceous
lime mudstone. Gas shows within the Mission Canyon ranged from 30 to 80 units against
10.9 pound/gallon mud weight.

The top of the Lodgepole Formation was logged at 9,887’ TVD (-7,863’). In general the
Lodgepole can be described as a medium to dark gray-brown, argillaceous /Jime mudstone
with crystalline texture and trace amounts of disseminated pyrite (Figure 3). The False
Bakken, drilled at 10,613’ TVD (-8,589’), is comprised of very dark brown to black,
calcareous, slightly pyritic shale (Figure 4). Strong hydrocarbon shows in the lower 100’
Lodgepole were as high as 297 units, which suggest that some of the oil and gas from the
Bakken shale may be exploiting fractures.

Figures 3 & 4: Wet cutting of the Lodgepole Formation (left) and False Bakken sub-interval (righ) at 10x.

The Bakken Formation has four formal members, an upper and lower black, fissile,
organic-rich pyritic shale, and a clastic and carbonate middle and lower member. The Upper
Bakken Shale Member was drilled at 10,624’ TVD (-8,600’) with sample returns typically
described as black, carbonaceous, petroliferous shale with trace amounts of disseminated
pyrite (Figure 5). The Middle Bakken Member, penetrated at 10,642’ TVD (-8,618’),
consists of a varying thickness and sequence of siltstone, limestone and silty sandstone
(Figure 6). Trace, spotty light brown oil staining was present along with gas shows as high
as 1,545 units.

SUMMARY

Nabors rig B25 successfully drilled a two-section, horizontal well within the Middle Bakken
Member at the Wade Federal 5300 21-30 13B. A net of 9,699’ was drilled within the Middle
Bakken. A mud program consisting of diesel invert (9.6—10.5 ppg), during the vertical and curve
build sections, and saline based mud (9.5-10.5 ppg), during the lateral maintained stable hole
conditions and permitted adequate analysis of gas concentrations.

Projections of dip were successfully used to maintain the well-bore in the Middle Bakken target
for 77% of the lateral. Samples from the target consisted of a light to medium gray, silty
sandstone with trace to occasional amounts of disseminated pyrite. Intergranular porosity
was generally seen throughout the entire lateral. Hydrocarbon shows in the target zone were low
to moderate. Samples from the ideal zone contained spotty light brown oil staining.

The Wade Federal 5300 21-30 13B will be fitted with a 4 %” production liner and swell packers

in preparation for a fracture stimulation that will determine the true commercial value of the
well. The well currently awaits fracture stimulation.

Using the aforementioned information gathered during drilling, offset log information and
the structural data provided from Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC., well-site
geologists were able to anticipate, and interpret the local, apparent dip during drilling of
the Wade Federal 5300 21-30 13B well. A total depth of 20,560’ MD was reached on
November 10", 2014 at 18:15 CT. The target resultant was 100% within the Middle
Bakken Member. The resulting structure of the Middle Bakken was a drop in TVD of
85.70’ over 9,699’, resulting in an overall down-dip of -0.51° as portrayed on the dip
profile (Figure 8).

Hydrocarbons:

Gas monitoring and fluid gains were monitored to evaluate the viability of this reservoir during the
drilling of the well. In the invert mud system, hydrostatic conditions were maintained near balance.
This allowed for gas and fluid gains from the well to be monitored.

Background gas observed during the lateral ranged from 50 to 450 units. The lateral was drilled with
saltwater drilling fluid, with a mud weight of 9.5-10.50 pounds/gallon. Gas shows typically ranged
from 200 to 300 units. In the latter half of the lateral, gas shows ranged up to 1,618 units and
connection gases were observed up to 1,850 units (Figure 9). C1-C4 gas components were observed
throughout the course of the lateral. Trip gases were observed as high as 200 units. Oil shows were very
light throughout the lateral ranging from 0-3% in sample. When present it presented as a light brown
spotty oil stain that yielded a slow to moderate streaming to diffuse light green cut fluorescence.

LITHOLOGY
Wade Federal 5300 21-30 13B

Rig crews caught lagged samples in 30’ intervals under the supervision of Sunburst geologists. A detailed list of
sampling intervals is included in the well data summary page. Sample or gamma ray marker tops have been inserted
in the sample descriptions below for reference. Samples were examined wet and dry under a binocular microscope.
Drilling fluid was diesel-based invert from surface casing to intermediate casing, while salt water drilling fluid was
used throughout the lateral. Sample collection began at 8,200’ MD.

Logging began in the Kibbey Formation

Survey Requirements for Horizontal, Horizontal Re-entry, and Directional Wells

NDAC Section 43-02-03-25 (Deviation Tests and Directional Surveys) states in part (that) the survey contractor shall file a
certified copy of all surveys with the director free of charge within thirty days of completion. Surveys must be submitted as
one electronic copy, or in a form approved by the director. However, the director may require the directional survey to be
filed immediately after completion if the survey is needed to conduct the operation of the director's office in a timely manner.
Certified surveys must be submitted via email in one adobe document, with a certification cover page to certsurvey@nd.gov.
Survey points shall be of such frequency to accurately determine the entire location of the well bore.
Specifically, the Horizontal and Directional well survey frequency is 100 feet in the vertical, 30 feet in the curve (or when
sliding) and 90 feet in the lateral.

Surface casing cement

Tail cement utilized on surface casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi within 12 hours, and tail
cement utilized on production casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi before drilling the plug or
initiating tests.

Logs

NDAC Section 43-02-03-31 requires the running of (1) a suite of open hole logs from which formation tops and
porosity zones can be determined, (2) a Gamma Ray Log run from total depth to ground level elevation of the well bore, and
(3) a log from which the presence and quality of cement can be determined (Standard CBL or Ultrasonic cement evaluation
log) in every well in which production or intermediate casing has been set, this log must be run prior to completing the well.
All logs run must be submitted free of charge, as one digital TIFF (tagged image file format) copy and one digital LAS (log
ASCH) formatted copy. Digital logs may be submitted on a standard CD, DVD, or attached to an email sent to
digitallogs@nd.gov

RE: HORIZONTAL WELL
WADE FEDERAL 5300 21-30 13B
LOT2 Section 30-153N-100W
McKenzie County
Well File # 28978

Dear Brandi:

Pursuant to Commission Order No. 23752, approval to drill the above captioned well is hereby given. The approval is
granted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than the 500" setback from
the north & south boundaries and 200" setback from the east & west boundaries within the 2560 acre spacing unit consisting
of Sections 29 & 30'T153N R100W. Tool error is not required pursuant to order.

PERMIT STIPULATIONS: Effective June 1, 2014, a covered leak-proof container (with placard) for filter sock
disposal must be maintained on the well site beginning when the well is spud, and must remain on-site during
clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations are conducted. Due to drainage adjacent to
the well site, a dike is required surrounding the entire location. OASIS PETRO NO AMER must contact NDIC
Field Inspector Richard Dunn at 701-770-3554 prior to location construction.

Drilling pit

NDAC 43-02-03-19.4 states that “a pit may be utilized to bury drill cuttings and solids generated during well drilling and
completion operations, providing the pit can be constructed, used and reclaimed in a manner that will prevent pollution of
the land surface and freshwaters. Reserve and circulation of mud system through earthen pits are prohibited. All pits shall be
inspected by an authorized representative of the director prior to lining and use. Drill cuttings and solids must be stabilized
in a manner approved by the director prior to placement in a cuttings pit.”

Form 1 Changes & Hard Lines

Any changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC. The
proposed directional plan is at a legal location. Based on the azimuth of the proposed lateral the maximum legal coordinate
from the well head is: 1074’N and 10043’E.

Location Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period)

Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the approved
drilling permit on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report. If circumstances requite operations to commence before the 3rd
business day following publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may be waived by the Director.
Application for a waiver must be by sworn affidavit providing the information necessary to evaluate the extenuating
circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f), and any other information that would allow the Director to
conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the drilling permit, the applicant should retain the permit.

Permit Fee & Notification

Payment was received in the amount of $100 via credit card .The permit fee has been received. It is requested that
notification be given immediately upon the spudding of the well. This information should be relayed to the Oil & Gas
Division, Bismarck, via telephone. The following information must be included: Well name, legal location, permit number,
drilling contractor, company representative, date and time of spudding. Office hours are 8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and 1:00

RE: Filter Socks and Other Filter Media
Leakproof Container Required
Oil and Gas Wells

Dear Operator,

North Dakota Administrative Code Section 43-02-03-19.2 states in part that all waste material associated with
exploration or production of oil and gas must be properly disposed of in an authorized facility in accord with all
applicable local, state, and federal laws and regulations.

Filtration systems are commonly used during oil and gas operations in North Dakota. The Commission is very
concerned about the proper disposal of used filters (including filter socks) used by the oil and gas industry.

Effective June 1, 2014, a container must be maintained on each well drilled in North Dakota beginning when the
well is spud and must remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations
are conducted. The on-site container must be used to store filters until they can be properly disposed of in an
authorized facility. Such containers must be:

e leakproof to prevent any fluids from escaping the container

e covered to prevent precipitation from entering the container

e placard to indicate only filters are to be placed in the container

If the operator will not utilize a filtration system, a waiver to the container requirement will be considered, but
only upon the operator submitting a Sundry Notice (Form 4) justifying their request.

As previously stated in our March 13, 2014 letter, North Dakota Administrative Code Section 33-20-02.1-01
states in part that every person who transports solid waste (which includes oil and gas exploration and production
wastes) is required to have a valid permit issued by the North Dakota Department of Health, Division of Waste
Management. Please contact the Division of Waste Management at (701) 328-5166 with any questions on the
solid waste program. Note oil and gas exploration and production wastes include produced water, drilling mud,
invert mud, tank bottom sediment, pipe scale, filters, and fly ash.

Thank you for your cooperation.

Sincerely,

Brace E. Fichs

Michael,

Just realized that since there is not cuttings pit, we need to know what facility you will be hauling the
cuttings to for all three wells.

Thanks and have a great Friday!

Michael,

It is my understanding that you just called looking to get the Wade Federal well pad issued ASAP,
however we have two issues with this well pad.

| talked to Brandi this morning about the 14T2 well. Right now you have the surface casing at 1974’,
and we need that to be modified so that it is at least 1980’.

For the 13B well, the bottom hole location violates the 200’ setback. According to the drilling plan, it
is located 10,142’ from the wellhead (the other two wells are 10,042’), which would therefore put it
at 101’ from the east line. | left Brandi a voicemail about this issue a few minutes ago.

The sooner we get these, the sooner we can get your permit.

Feel free to contact me with any questions regarding these issues.

Thanks,

Ashley N. Burk
