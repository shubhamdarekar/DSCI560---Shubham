DETAILS OF WORK

Oasis Petroleum North America LLC requests a waiver from the tubing/pkr requirement included in

ND/A\C 43-02-03-21: Casing, tubing, and cementing requirements during the completion period immediately
following the upcoming fracture stimulation.

The following assurances apply:

. The well is equiped with new 29 & 32# casing at surface with an API burst rating of 11,220 psi

. The frac design will use a safety factor of 0.85 API burst rating to determine the maximum pressure.

. [amage to the casing during the frac would be detected immediately by monitoring equipment.

. The casing is exposed to significantly lower rates and pressures during flow back than during the frac job.
. The frac fluid and formation fluids have very low corrosion and erosion rates.

. Froduction equipment will be installed as soon as possible after the well ceases flowing.

. 4, 300# gauge will be installed on the surface casing during the flowback period.

Oasis will allocate production measured at the central production facility to the various wells on the basis of isolated
production tests utilizing oil, gas and water meters on a test seperator at the central production facility. Oasis will
measure the production from each weil separately each month for a minimum of three days. Oasis believes that such
allocation will result in an accurate determination of production from each well. Tank vapor gas is being recovered
and burned by a 98% DRE enclosed combuster.

@ Summary

The Jefferies 5301 43-12B was spud 31 January 2012 in the Baker Field in McKenzie
County, North Dakota.

Bit #1 was used to drill the vertical section from the conductor pipe at 105’ to 2,190’.
Surface casing was set at 2,170’ and isolated with 9 %&” 36# J-55 casing pipe. Bit #2
was used to drill the remainder of the vertical hole to a total depth of 10,270’.

Bit #3 was used to drill the first 449° of the curve and was replaced with a tricone bit due
to inadequate build rates. Bit #4 drilled the final 391’ of the curve which allowed for the
build rates needed to reach the landing target.

Intermediate casing was set to 11,093’ MD / ~ 10,746’ TVD and isolated with 7” casing
pipe. Bit #5 was used to drill out of intermediate casing and drilled the entire 10,140’
lateral.

The target zone consisted of a 9’ thick vertical section of the Middle Member of the
Bakken Formation situated 10’ to 19’ feet below the Upper Shale of the Bakken
Formation. The target zone was identified at the top and bottom by low gamma
readings.

Background gas levels ranged from ~2,700 to ~3,400 units while drilling the lateral.
Gas was diverted through the gas buster producing an average flare of 2’ to 6’
throughout the lateral.

The Middle Member of the Bakken Formation observed in cutting samples consisted of
two primary facies observed while drilling in the target zone: 1) light gray silty sandstone
with visible oil staining and 2) light gray silty sandstone with trace amounts of patchy oil
stain.

Drilling operations were ceased on 21 February 2012 at 11:33 hours at an approximate
bottom hole location of 829.15’ E & 10,518.38’ S of surface location or approximately
268.38’ FSL & 2,027.93’ FEL in SWSE Section 24 T153N R101W.

Well Evaluation
Synopsis

The Jefferies 5301 43-12B [SWSE Section 12, T153N, R101W] is a horizontal well located in
the Baker Field in McKenzie County, North Dakota approximately 6 miles south of Williston.
The prognosis proposed a single lateral leg trending due south to be drilled through sections
13 and 24 from the SWSE corner of Section 12 to the SE SW corner of Section 24. The lateral
portion of the Jefferies 5301 43-12B targeted the porous silty sandstone of the Middle Member
of the Bakken Formation, approximately 10’ to 19’ below the Upper Shale of the Bakken
Formation.

Geologic Assessment

Methods

Geologic support of the Jefferies 5301 43-12B was provided by experienced RPM Well Site
Geologists. _Gas and chromatograph levels were measured using iBall Instruments
Bloodhound (Bloodhound) real time gas detector and chromatograph system. The
Bloodhound gas detection system uses non-dispersive infrared and chemical sensor gas
detection to evaluate gases liberated from the formation by the drill bit and carried to the
surface by the drilling fluid.

The Bloodhound was interfaced with a RigWatch Drilling Recorder system. RigWatch
provided rate of penetration (ROP), on-off bottom and pump strokes to the Bloodhound and
received total gas information from the Bloodhound for viewing on location and remotely.

Under the direction of RPM well site geologists, rig crews caught lagged drill cutting samples at
30’ intervals from 8,300’ through 10,780’. Samples were logged at 10’ intervals during the
curve from 10,780’ to 11,050’. Throughout the lateral section, samples were continuously
logged at 30’ intervals until total depth 21,250’.

Sampled drill cuttings were examined wet and dry under a binocular microscope using plain
(broad spectrum) and transmitted light. Cuttings were evaluated for hydrocarbon “cut” by
immersion in Entron critical cleaning solvent and inspected under a UV fluoroscope. Alizarin
red stain and ten percent hydrochloric acid were used to determine the calcareous and
dolomitic content of rocks and cementing.

e Control Wells

Two completed wells were used as control wells for the Jefferies 5301 43-12B. During the
curve, the gamma-ray data and e-log data from the Lindvig 11-1HR and the Achilles 5301 41-
12B were used to determine the curve landing depth for the Jefferies 5301 43-12B.

The Lindvig 11-1HR [SESE Section 11, T153N, R101W] is located ~ 0.5 miles east of Jefferies
5301 43-12B. The Lindvig 11-1HR was spud on 11 December 1982 by Gulf Oil Corporation
under the original well name N. Alexander #1-11-3C. This well is currently operated by SM
Energy Company. The Lindvig 11-1HR was drilled to the Red River Formation with a total
depth 14,461’. Production was established in both the Madison and Red River intervals.
Cumulative production from the Madison Group has been recorded as 203,232 bbis of oil,
242,165 bbls of water and 242,165 MCF gas. The production status for the Red River
Formation has been listed as dry.

The Achilles 5301 41-12B [SWSW Section 12, T153N, R101W] is located within the same
section approximately one half mile west of the Jefferies 5301 43-12B. The Achilles 5301 41-
12B was spud on 3 January 2012 by Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC. The Achilles 5301
@ 41-12B is a horizontal well drilled through the Middle Member of the Bakken Formation. Initial
production data for the Achilles 5301 41-12B had not been disclosed at the time of this report.

To define the initial landing target, Table 1 was constructed to calculate the distance of
formation tops and Lodgepole markers to the target depth determined from the both offset
wells. The comparison showed distance to the landing target from the Lodgepole Formation
averaged 738’ between the Lindvig 11-1HR and the Achilles 5301 41-12B.

The initial kick off point (KOP) was projected at 10,300’ (-8,182’). The bottom hole assembly
for the curve build was picked up at 10,270’ (-8,152’) on 7 February 2012. The Lodgepole
Formation top was picked from MWD gamma data at 10,010’ (-7,892). Utilizing the Upper
Bakken Shale isopach map and the distance to target from both control wells, the landing
target for the Jefferies 5301 43-12B was set at 10,750’ (-8,632’) total vertical depth (TVD).

During the curve progression, Lodgepole markers A through F were used to help determine
the landing target and aid directional drillers to calculate the curve build. The close proximity
of the control wells in addition to the marker picks determined the landing target would remain
at 10,750’ TVD.

Vertical Operations

Overview

RPM well site geologists arrived at site on 5 February 2012 and began logging the vertical
section at 8,300’ shortly before picking the top of the limestone marker of the Kibbey Formation
at 8,390’ (-6,272’).

The Jefferies 5301 43-12B was spud on 1 February 2012 using Nabors #149 drilling rig.
Nabors #149 was used to drill the surface from the conductor at 105’ to 2,190’ using fresh
water. Surface casing was set to 2,170’ and isolated with 9 %” 36# J-55 casing pipe.

Bit #1 (13.5” JZ HC605) was used to drill from 105’to 2,190’ in 13 hours with an average ROP
of 160.4 feet per hour. Bit #2 was used to drill the 8,080’ vertical section from surface casing
to KOP at 10,270’ (-8,152’) in 79.5 hours with an average ROP of 101.6 feet per hour.

Diesel invert drilling fluid with a mud weight ranging from 9.5 to 10.3 ppg was used during the
vertical hole from surface casing through the curve build and landing at 11,110’ MD / ~10,748’

@ Directional Operations

RPM geologists worked closely with onsite MWD and Directional Drilling technicians to
formulate steering decisions to maximize exposure of borehole in the pay zone. MWD
gamma-ray information and penetration rates were closely observed to aid in steering
decisions and dip degree estimations. Ryan Energy provided equipment and personnel for
MWD and Directional Drilling services.

Curve Build Section
Overview

During the curve progression, isopach data and gamma signatures from the Lindvig 11-1HR
and the Achilles 5301 41-12B were compared to gamma readings from the MWD tool below

the Lodgepole Formation. Six possible Lodegpole markers were identified to determine the
target landing point.

11-1HR as formation tops and marker picks were made available from gamma ray data provided by Ryan Energy.

The curve was started at the kick off point of 10,300’ using a PDC bit. Bit #3 (Halliburtin
FXD55M) was used from 10,270’ to 10,560’ for 9 hours. Bit #3 was rerun after a trip out of the
hole to adjust the mud motor from 2.3° to 2.45° due to inadequate build rates. At 10,719’ the
bottom hole assembly was replaced a 2.35" motor and bit #4 which was a more aggressive
tricone bit. This bottom hole assembly provided the build rates needed to land on target. The
curve was landed at 90°. While drilling 65’ of rathole, the inclination increased to 92.00’,
followed by 92.60° during the next two surveys. Directional slid down to correct with the next
consecutive surveys recorded as 89.40° and 87.40".

The curve was landed in the Middle Member of the Bakken Formation ~ 6’ below the base of
the Upper Bakken Shale. The curve was completed on 10 November 2012 at 11,110’ MD /
~10,748’ TVD. Intermediate casing (7”) was set to 11,093’ MD.

Lithology

The top of the False Bakken marker was logged at 10,810’ MD / ~ 10,718’ TVD. A weak gas
show of 332 units was recorded while drilling through the False Bakken marker.

The Upper Shale of the Bakken Formation [Mississippian — Devonian] was drilled at 10,823’
MD / ~ 10,725’ TVD. The top of the Upper Shale is 5’ low compared to offset well, Lindvig 11-
1HR. The Upper Shale was described as black, carbonaceous and petroliferous shale (Figure
6) characterized by gamma-ray values in excess of 250 API counts. Due to a previously
unrecognized gas trap glitch, gas levels were recorded with a peak of 481’ units while drilling
through the Upper Bakken Shale. Samples were described as:

SHALE: black, firm, subblocky, waxy texture, very carbonaceous, very slightly calcareous, petroliferous,
visible oil stain, no visible porosity

Figure 6. Upper Bakken Shale.

The Middle Member of the Bakken Formation was picked at 11,888’ MD / ~10,740’ TVD, 5’ low
to Lindvig 11-1HR. Samples from Middle Member of the Bakken Formation observed during
the curve build section were described as:

SILTY SANDSTONE: light to medium gray, white in part, very fine grained, subrounded to rounded, firm,
moderately sorted, occasional calcite fracture fill, trace nodules pyrite, dolomitic cement, visible
intergranular porosity

SILTY SANDSTONE: light brown, light gray, white in part, very fine grained, subrounded to rounded, firm,

moderately to poorly sorted, trace disseminated pyrite, very sandy, dolomitic cement, visible intergranular
porosity, visible light brown oil stain

Lateral Section

Overview

Drilling fluid consisting of a salt water program (9.7 to 9.9 ppg) while drilling the lateral section.
The drilling mud was successful in preserving stable hole conditions, minimizing washout
through the salt intervals and maintaining hydrostatic balance.

One 6” Security DBS PDC bit was used to drill the lateral section. Bit #5 was used to drill out
of intermediate casing to 13,534’ MD in 35.5 hours averaging 68.3 feet per hour. Bit #5 was
run a second time after a trip out of the hole to replace the mud motor. The new motor was
adjusted to 1.83°. Bit #5RR1 drilled to 20,085’ MD in 88 hours with an average drill rate of
74.4 feet per hour. Bit #5 was run a third time after a trip out of the hole to replace the motor.
Bit #5RR2 drill to total depth of 21,250’.

Target Zone

The target zone was a nine foot vertical section ranging from 10’ to 19’ below the Upper
Bakken Shale. A type log (Figure 7) was adapted from a nearby offset well demonstrating the
general gamma character. The target zone was bound by a low gamma marker (~ 50 to ~ 55
API) near the top of the zone. The bottom of the zone was also bound by a low gamma
signature (~ 50 to ~ 58 API). The middle of the target zone was characterized by “ratty”
gamma which ranged from ~ 50 to ~80 API counts.

@ Gas and Hydrocarbon Shows

Gas shows were weak through the Charles Formation. Total gas levels elevated significantly
near the Base Last Salt with an average background gas of ~ 270 units with recurring peaks of
~330 to ~450 units. A peak of 528 units was recorded in the lower Mission Canyon Formation.

During the curve, the average background gas was ~200 units. A weak gas show of 481 units
was recorded while drilling through the Upper Bakken Shale. Repairs were made to gas trap
equipment before drilling resumed in the lateral. The average background gas recorded during
the lateral ranged from ~2,800 to ~3,400 units. Gas was diverted and a steady 2’ to 6’ flare
was produced. Trip gas produced significant flares of up to approximately 12’. The

LITHOLOGY

Rig crews caught lagged drill cutting samples at 30’ intervals from 8,360’ through 10,780’.
Samples were logged at 10’ intervals during the curve from 10,780’ to 11,050’. Samples were
continuously logged at 30’ intervals throughout the lateral section.

Electric geophysical log, sample and/or MWD gamma ray markers and tops are included in the
sample descriptions below for reference. Samples were examined wet and dry under a
binocular microscope and checked for hydrocarbon cut fluorescence with Entron critical
cleaning solvent in approximately 30’ intervals. Sample descriptions begin just above the
limestone marker in the Kibbey Formation. Drilling fluids consisted diesel invert during vertical
and curve build sections and salt water during lateral to TD.

RE: HORIZONTAL WELL
JEFFERIES 5301 43-12B
SWSE Section 12-153N-101W
McKenzie County
Well File # 22220
Dear Kaitlin:

Pursuant to Commission Order No. 18012, approval to drill the above captioned well is hereby given. The
approval is granted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than
the 200' setback from the north & south boundaries and 500' setback from the east & west boundaries within
the 1280 acre spacing unit consisting of Sections 13 & 24-T153N-R101W.

PERMIT STIPULATIONS: A Closed Mud System is required on multi-well pads, although the
disposal of drill cuttings is contingent upon site specific conditions to be determined by an NDIC Field
Inspector. In cases where a spacing unit is accessed from an off-site drill pad, an affidavit must be
provided affirming that the surface owner of the multi-well pad agrees to accept burial on their property
of the cuttings generated from drilling the well(s) into an offsite spacing/drilling unit. OASIS PETRO
NO AMER must contact NDIC Field Inspector Marc Binns at 701-220-5989 prior to location
construction.

Form 1 Changes & Hard Lines

Any changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC.
The proposed directional plan is at a legal location. The minimum legal coordinates from the well head at casing
point is: 450’ S & 1910’ E. Also, based on the azimuth of the proposed lateral the maximum legal coordinates
from the well head is: 1910’ E & 10586’ S.

Location Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period)

Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the
approved drilling permit on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report. If circumstances require operations to
commence before the 3rd business day following publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may
be waived by the Director. Application for a waiver must be by sworn affidavit providing the information
necessary to evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(, and any other
information that would allow the Director to conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the
drilling permit, the applicant should retain the permit.

Permit Fee & Notification

Payment was received in the amount of $100 via credit card .The permit fee has been received. It is requested
that notification be given immediately upon the spudding of the well. This information should be relayed to the

600 E Boulevard Ave - Dept 405, Bismarck, North Dakota 58505-0840 Phone (701)328-8020 Fax (701)328-8022

Oil & Gas Division, Bismarck, via telephone. The following information must be included: Well name, legal
location, permit number, drilling contractor, company representative, date and time of spudding. Office hours are
8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. Central Time. Our telephone number is (701) 328-8020, leave a
message if after hours or on the weekend.

Survey Requirements for Horizontal, Horizontal Re-entry, and Directional Wells

NDAC Section 43-02-03-25 (Deviation Tests and Directional Surveys) states in part (that) the survey contractor
shall file a certified copy of all surveys with the director free of charge within thirty days of completion. Surveys
must be submitted as one electronic copy, or in a form approved by the director. However, the director may
require the directional survey to be filed immediately after completion if the survey is needed to conduct the
operation of the director's office in a timely manner. Certified surveys must be submitted via email in one adobe
document, with a certification cover page to certsurvey@nd.gov.
Survey points shall be of such frequency to accurately determine the entire location of the well bore.

Reserve pit
Please be advised that conditions may be imposed on the use and reclamation of a drilling reserve pit on
this site if specific site conditions warrant.

Surface casing cement

Tail cement utilized on surface casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi within 12
hours, and tail cement utilized on production casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi
before drilling the plug or initiating tests.

Logs

NDAC Section 43-02-03-31 requires the running of a Cement Bond Log from which the presence of
cement can be determined in every well in which production or intermediate casing has been set and a Gamma
Ray Log must be run from total depth to ground level elevation of the well bore. All logs must be submitted as
one paper copy and one digital copy in LAS (Log ASCII) format, or a format approved by the Director. Image
logs that include, but are not limited to, Mud Logs, Cement Bond Logs, and Cyberlook Logs, cannot be produced
in their entirety as LAS (Log ASCI)) files. To create a solution and establish a standard format for industry to
follow when submitting image logs, the Director has given approval for the operator to submit an image log as a
TIFF (*.tif) formatted file. The TIFF (*.tif) format will be accepted only when the log cannot be produced in its
entirety as a LAS (Log ASCII) file format. The digital copy may be submitted on a 3.5” floppy diskette, a standard
CD, or attached to an email sent to digitallogs@nd.gov

Thank you for your cooperation.
Sincerely,

David Tabor

NOTE: A Gamma Ray log must be run to ground surface and a CBL must be run on intermediate or longstring casing string if set.

Surveys are required at least every 30 feet in the build section and every 90 feet in the lateral section of a horizontal well. Measurement
inaccuracies are not considered when determining compliance with the spacing/drilling unit boundary setback requirement except in the
following scenarios: 1) When the angle between the well bore and the respective boundary is 10 degrees or less; or 2) If Industry standard
methods and equipment are not utilized. Consult the applicable field order for exceptions.

If measurement inaccuracies are required to be considered, a 2° MWD measurement inaccuracy will be applied to the horizontal portion of the well
bore. This measurement inaccuracy is applied to the well bore from KOP to TD.

REQUIRED ATTACHMENTS: Certified surveyor's plat, horizontal section plat, estimated geological tops, proposed mud/cementing plan,
directional plot/plan, $100 fee.
