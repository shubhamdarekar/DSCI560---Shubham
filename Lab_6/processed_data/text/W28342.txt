GEOLOGIC EVALUATION
Methods:

Geologic supervision of the Chalmers 5301 44-24 2TR was provided by Sunburst Consulting,
Inc. with two well site geologists. A digital gas detector and chromatograph were interfaced with
a Pason electronic data recorder system. The unit of measure for gas on this well was units (u),
which was defined as 100 units equaling 1% methane equivalent in air. The EDR provided drill
rate, on-off bottom and pump strokes to the gas detection computer and received total gas
information from Sunburst for viewing around location. Lagged samples were caught by the rig
crew in 30’ intervals from 4,930’ MD to 5,993’ MD, 30’ intervals from 8,170’ MD to
10,870’MD, 10’ intervals from 10,870’ MD to 11,043’ MD, and 30’ intervals from 11,043’ MD
to 20,904’ TD. Wet and dry cuttings were examined under a tri-ocular microscope and complete
lithologic descriptions and sampling intervals are provided in the lithology document within this
evaluation. The set of dry cuttings collected during the duration of the well were sent to the State
of North Dakota. Evidence of light hydrocarbons present in the drilling fluid was reported by the
gas chromatography equipment and documented on the mud log presented with this report.

Figure 5 & 6: Wet cuttings of the Upper Bakken Shale (left), Lower Bakken Shale (right) at 10X.

The Three Forks Formation (Devonian; Kaskaskia Sequence) represents a regressive
sequence deposited in a supratidal sabkha environment. The top of the Three Forks was
drilled at 10,674’ TVD (-8,706’) and is comprised of a light to medium gray, cream to off
white sucrosic dolomite with trace to occasional amounts of disseminated pyrite and light
green shale also with trace amounts of disseminated pyrite (Figure 7 & 8). Shows within
the Three Forks Formation ranged from 50 to 500 units in a drilling mud of 9.6-9.9 ppg.

Geo-steering:

Kick-off point for the curve was established from the isopach of the “base last salt” marker
to the Three Forks “target” in the offset wells. The Chalmers 5300 31-19H was used as the
primary offset through the vertical and curve sections. While drilling the curve, measured
gamma ray signatures were compared to those of the three offsets and aided in the landing of
the curve. The landing target was confirmed by the depth of the False Bakken, which was
consistent with the offset wells. The curve was successfully landed within the Three Forks
Formation at a depth of 11,043’ MD (10,695’ TVD) placing the well bore approximately 21’
below the top of the Three Forks Formation. Directional tools were then pulled out of the
hole and a string of 7” casing was set (11,043’ MD) and then cemented by Schlumberger.

Samples from the target zone varied in porosity, oil staining, color, cementation, and pyrite
content. Stratigraphic location in the target zone was based on these sample observations
along with gas shows, drill rates and gamma ray values. Severe doglegs were to be avoided
so as to obtain the desired vertical section and aid in a successful completion liner run at TD.

The Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC prospect geologist defined the an initial target
zone as an 13’ zone that began 8’ below the top of the Three Forks Formation and ended four
feet above the claystone member 21’ below the Three Forks Formation. The target zone
consisted of an upper dolomite and shale interval reading 100-140 count gamma (A marker).
The center of the target interval was comprised of a warmer dolomite with greater amounts
of shale reading 120-160 count gamma (B marker). The base of the target zone was
characterized by a clean dolomite with trace amounts of shale with gamma readings of 50-
100 (C marker). The A-C gamma markers were used for determining depth within the target
interval and plotted on the Chalmers 5301 44-24 2TR dip profile (Figure 10).

Using the aforementioned information gathered during drilling, offset log information and
the structural data provided from Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC., well site
geologists were able to anticipate, and interpret the local apparent dip during the drilling of
the Chalmers 5301 44-24 2TR well. Upon drilling out of casing a misaligned MWD lead to a
Pronghorn strike. After a successful sidetrack, the BHA only drill about 1,600’ before

Zones of Interest:

The Mission Canyon Formation (Mississippian; Madison Group) was drilled at 9,286’ TVD
(-7,318’) and is comprised largely of light gray lime mudstone followed by gray to tan earthy
textured argillaceous lime mudstone. Shows within the Mission Canyon ranged from 40 to 87
units against 10.0 ppg mud.

Figure 3 & 4: Wet cutting of the Lodgepole Formation (left) and False Bakken sub-interval (right) at 10X.

The top of the Lodgepole Formation was logged at 9,845’ TVD (-7,877’). In general the
Lodgepole can be described as a medium to dark gray brown argillaceous lime mudstone with a
crystalline texture and trace amounts of disseminated pyrite (Figure 3). The False Bakken
(Carrington Shale), drilled at 10,577’ TVD (-8,609’), is comprised of very dark brown to black,
slightly pyritic shale with an earthy texture, and was found to be soft to firm (Figure 4). Strong
hydrocarbon shows in the lower 100’ of the Lodgepole were as high as 168 total gas units;
suggest that some of the oil and gas from the Upper Bakken Shale may be exploiting fractures
thought to exist in the Lower Lodgepole.

The Bakken Formation (Devonian — Mississippian) has four formal members, an upper and
lower black, fissile, organic-rich pyritic shale, separated by an arenaceous limestone, siltstone
and silty sandstone middle member. These three members overlay a silty shale or siltstone of the
Pronghorn Member toward the basin depositional center. The Upper Bakken Shale was drilled at
10,585’ TVD (-8,617’) with sample returns typically described as black, carbonaceous,
petroliferous shale with trace amounts of disseminated pyrite (Figure 5). The Middle Bakken,
penetrated at 10,602’ TVD (-8,634’), consists of a varying thickness and sequence of interbedded
siltstone, limestone and silty sandstone. Trace spotty light brown oil staining was present along
with gas shows as high as 1325 TGU. This light brown spotty oil staining was common.
Penetrated at 10,644’ TVD (-8,676’), the Lower Bakken Shale was described as a black to dark
brown carbonaceous shale with trace amounts of disseminated pyrite (Figure 6). Gas shows
encountered in the Lower Bakken read as high as 550u (C1-C4). The Pronghorn was penetrated
at 10,655 TVD (-8,687’) and is commonly described as a dark to medium gray siltstone with
calcite cement.

SUMMARY

The Nabors B25 drilling rig successfully drilled a two-section horizontal well bore within the
Three Forks Formation at the Chalmers 5301 44-24 2TR. A net of 9,998’ was drilled within the
Three Forks. A mud program consisting of diesel invert (10.0-11.6 ppg), during the vertical and
curve build sections, and saline based mud (9.6-9.90 ppg), during the lateral maintained stable
hole conditions and permitted adequate analysis of gas concentrations.

Projections of dip were successfully used to maintain the well bore in the Three Forks Formation
target for 76% of the lateral. Samples from the target consisted of a light to medium gray,
cream to off white dolomite with trace to occasional amounts of disseminated pyrite and
light green shale also with trace amounts of disseminated pyrite. Intercrystalline porosity was
generally seen throughout the entire lateral. Hydrocarbon shows in the target zone were high
throughout the lateral. Samples from the ideal zone contained a spotty light brown oil stain.

The Chalmers 5301 44-24 2TR will be fitted with a 4 %” production liner and swell packers in
preparation for a fracture stimulation that will determine the true commercial value of the well.
The well currently awaits fracture stimulation.

striking the Pronghorn again, due to a steep inclination caused by a deflection off a hard
streak. After a second successful sidetrack a total depth of 20,904’ MD was reached on
June 11, 2014 at 10:30 CDT. The resulting structure of the Three Forks was a fall in TVD
of 87’ over 9,998’ MD; resulting in an overall down dip of 0.50° as portrayed on the
Chalmers 5301 44-24 2TR dip profile (Figure 10).

Hydrocarbons:

Gas monitoring and fluid gains were monitored to evaluate the viability of this reservoir during the
drilling of the Chalmers 5301 44-24 2TR well. In the invert mud system, hydrostatic conditions were
maintained near balance. This allowed for gas and fluid gains from the well to be monitored. Gas
shows were encountered in vertical, curve and lateral drilling of the well.

Background gas observed during the drilling of the lateral ranged from 50 to 200 units. Invert drilling
fluid was used throughout the drilling of the vertical and curve weighing 10.0-11.6 ppg. The lateral was
drilled with saline drilling fluid with a mud weight of 9.6-9.9 ppg. Gas shows ranged up to 852 units
and connection gases were observed up to 508 units. C1-C4 gas components were observed throughout
the course of the lateral. Trip gases were observed as high as 2,048 units. Oil shows were very light
throughout the lateral ranging from 0-3% in sample. When present it was a light brown spotty oil stain
that yielded a slow to moderate streaming to diffuse light green cut fluorescence.

LITHOLOGY

Rig crews caught lagged samples in 30’ intervals under the supervision of Sunburst geologists. A
detailed list of sampling intervals is included in the well data summary page. Sample or gamma ray
marker tops have been inserted in the sample descriptions below for reference. Samples were examined
wet and dry under a trinocular microscope. The drilling fluid was diesel-based invert from surface
casing to intermediate casing, while salt water drilling fluid was used throughout the lateral. Sample
collection began at 4,960’ MD.

include the following change:
Cement entire 4.5" liner from TD to liner top at KOP. |

Reasoning for the change is as follows: 7" casing string was successfully landed across the 200' setback In Section
19. Shoe is estimated at 11,014" (~550' E of SHL or 105' past hardline). Pumps were brought on in order to establish
circulation and the hole packed off around the 7" casing string, making circulation impossible. The casing string
was slowly worked in order to attempt to clear up obstruction and circulation was never achieved. Called Rick Dunn
at NDIC and notified him of intention to perforate casing behind hardline, in Middle Bakken, and cement through
perforation holes. Perfed at est 10,725’ MD (272' E of SHL or 173' short of hardline). Cemented through perfs.

Oasis Petroleum will verify isolation across the hardline from cemented liner with a CBL, prior to completing the
well,

DETAILS OF PROCEDURE

This well is the replacement well for the Chalmers Wade Federal 5301 44-24 12T which was PA due to a water flow
from the Dakota Formation. All four initial wells on this pad had received a log waiver due to another Oasis well
located several hundered feet away having run a full suite of logs. A waiver has been requested and submitted but has
not been processed yet. Rig will finish curve sometime in the next 24 hours and will run casing. Permission for a log
waiver is granted.

SESE Section 24-153N-101W
McKenzie County
Well File # 28342
Dear Mike :

Pursuant to Commission Order No. 23752, approval to drill the above captioned well is hereby given. The
approval is granted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than
the 500' setback from the north & south boundaries and 200' setback from the east & west boundaries within
the 1280 acre spacing unit consisting of Section 19 & 20 T153N R100W.

PERMIT STIPULATIONS: DUE TO STREAM ADJACENT TO THE WELL SITE, A DIKE IS
REQUIRED SURROUNDING THE ENTIRE LOCATION. OASIS PETRO NO AMER must
contact NDIC Field Inspector Richard Dunn at 701-770-3554 prior to SETTING CONDUCTOR.

Drilling pit

NDAC 43-02-03-19.4 states that “a pit may be utilized to bury drill cuttings and solids generated during well
drilling and completion operations, providing the pit can be constructed, used and reclaimed in a manner that will
prevent pollution of the land surface and freshwaters. Reserve and circulation of mud system through earthen pits
are prohibited. All pits shall be inspected by an authorized representative of the director prior to lining and use.
Drill cuttings and solids must be stabilized in a manner approved by the director prior to placement in a cuttings

pit.”

Form 1 Changes & Hard Lines

Any changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC.
The proposed directional plan is at a legal location. The minimum legal coordinate from the well head at casing
point is: 445E. Also, based on the azimuth of the proposed lateral the maximum legal coordinate from the well
head is: 459S & 10534E.

Location Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period)

Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the
approved drilling permit on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report. If circumstances require operations to
commence before the 3rd business day following publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may

Survey Requirements for Horizontal, Horizontal Re-entry, and Directional Wells

NDAC Section 43-02-03-25 (Deviation Tests and Directional Surveys) states in part (that) the survey contractor
shall file a certified copy of all surveys with the director free of charge within thirty days of completion. Surveys
must be submitted as one electronic copy, or in a form approved by the director. However, the director may
require the directional survey to be filed immediately after completion if the survey is needed to conduct the
operation of the director's office in a timely manner. Certified surveys must be submitted via email in one adobe
document, with a certification cover page to certsurvey@nd.gov.
Survey points shall be of such frequency to accurately determine the entire location of the well bore.
Specifically, the Horizontal and Directional well survey frequency is 100 feet in the vertical, 30 feet in the curve
(or when sliding) and 90 feet in the lateral.

Surface casing cement

Tail cement utilized on surface casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi within 12
hours, and tail cement utilized on production casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi
before drilling the plug or initiating tests.

Logs

NDAC Section 43-02-03-31 requires the running of (1) a suite of open hole logs from which formation tops and
porosity zones can be determined, (2) a Gamma Ray Log run from total depth to ground level elevation of the well bore, and
(3) a log from which the presence and quality of cement can be determined (Standard CBL or Ultrasonic cement evaluation
log) in every well in which production or intermediate casing has been set, this log must be run prior to completing the well.
All logs run must be submitted free of charge, as one digital TIFF (tagged image file format) copy and one digital LAS (log
ASCH) formatted copy. Digital logs may be submitted on a standard CD, DVD, or attached to an email sent to

RE: Filter Socks and Other Filter Media
Leakproof Container Required
Oil and Gas Wells

Dear Operator,

North Dakota Administrative Code Section 43-02-03-19.2 states in part that all waste material associated with
exploration or production of oil and gas must be properly disposed of in an authorized facility in accord with all
applicable local, state, and federal laws and regulations.

Filtration systems are commonly used during oil and gas operations in North Dakota. The Commission is very
concerned about the proper disposal of used filters (including filter socks) used by the oil and gas industry.

Effective June 1, 2014, a container must be maintained on each well drilled in North Dakota beginning when the
well is spud and must remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations
are conducted. The on-site container must be used to store filters until they can be properly disposed of in an
authorized facility. Such containers must be:

e leakproof to prevent any fluids from escaping the container

e covered to prevent precipitation from entering the container

e placard to indicate only filters are to be placed in the container

If the operator will not utilize a filtration system, a waiver to the container requirement will be considered, but
only upon the operator submitting a Sundry Notice (Form 4) justifying their request.

As previously stated in our March 13, 2014 letter, North Dakota Administrative Code Section 33-20-02.1-01
states in part that every person who transports solid waste (which includes oil and gas exploration and production
wastes) is required to have a valid permit issued by the North Dakota Department of Health, Division of Waste
Management. Please contact the Division of Waste Management at (701) 328-5166 with any questions on the
solid waste program. Note oil and gas exploration and production wastes include produced water, drilling mud,
invert mud, tank bottom sediment, pipe scale, filters, and fly ash.

Thank you for your cooperation.

Sincerely,

Brace E. Fichs

Assistant Director

North Dakota Oil and Gas Division
5/9/2014

To whom it may concern:

Oasis Petroleum (with Nabors B25) had a water influx of around 600bbls on the Chalmers Wade Federal
5301 44-24 12T, early morning of 5/8/14. Permission was granted to plug the well on the morning of
5/9/14.

Pending full approval from the North Dakota Industrial Commission, Oasis Petroleum is proposing to drill
a new well according to this APD request.

Due to our experience with the Gramma Federal well (~2 miles to the south) about 1.5 years ago, where
we ended up having to abandon the well after getting stuck with 7” casing, we respectfully propose the
course of action below:

1. Plug the Chalmers Wade Federal 5301 44-24 12T per NDIC requirements. Approval granted 5/9-
14

2. Move to north end of pad and drill the Chalmers 5301 44-24 2TX. Set 13-3/8” surface casing,
followed by 9-5/8” intermediate casing across the Dakota, sealing off likely flow.

3. Drill down into Mission Canyon and attempt to seal up Mission Canyon, so that it is able to hold
~11.4 ppg mud and drill ahead. If unsuccessful, reduce mud weight and proceed ahead.

4. Drill curve, set 7” casing, and lateral through Bakken pool. Run 4.5” liner

With the above plan, we hope to test whether or not the Mission Canyon can be sealed up enough to
hold back the approximately 11.4 ppg mud that would be required to prevent flow from the Dakota. If
this test is successful, we would plan to make use of the existing 3 surface holes on the pad.

If we are unable to seal the Mission Canyon, we would proceed to drop mud weight and continue on to
drill the curve and lateral as outlined above. We would then seek permission to plug the 3 existing
surface holes per NDIC guidelines and set 3 more 13-3/8” surface casing strings, with previously
described 9-5/8” across the Dakota and then 7” casing through the curve.

Mike Brown
