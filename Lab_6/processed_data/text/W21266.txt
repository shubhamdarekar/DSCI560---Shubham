Well File No. 21266
STRIPPER WELL DETERMINATION

Dear Mr. Travis:

Oasis Petroleum North America LLC (Oasis) filed with the North Dakota Industrial Commission
~— Oil and Gas Division (Commission) on January 14, 2019 an application for a Stripper Well
Property Determination for the above captioned well.

Information contained in the application indicates that the above mentioned well is a property
pursuant to statute and rule, and Oasis has elected to designate said well as a separate property
for stripper well purposes. The well produced from a well depth greater than 10000 feet. During
the qualifying period, August 1, 2016 through July 31, 2017, the well produced at a maximum
efficient rate or was not capable of exceeding the production threshold. The average daily
production from the well was 29.9 barrels of oil per day during this period.

It is therefore determined that the above captioned well qualifies as a “Stripper Well Property”
pursuant to Section 57-51.1-01 of the North Dakota Century Code. This determination is

applicable only to the Bakken Pool in and under said property.

The Commission shall have continuing jurisdiction, and shall have the authority to review the
matter, and to amend or rescind the determination if such action is supported by additional or
newly discovered information. If you have any questions, do not hesitate to contact me.

Sincerely,

David J. McCusker
Petroleum Engineer

OFFSET WELLS

Three offset weils were used to estimate formation tops and landing target on Dahl 15-11H.
These wells were the SM Energy Co., Lindvig 1-11HR, located 0.38 miles northeast, the SM
Energy Co., M&G 14-2HR located 1.18 miles northwest, and the SM Energy Co., Rosebud 22-11
located 0.7 miles northwest. The Lindvig 1-11HR was closest and most helpful in estimating
Middle Bakken entry during curve operations.

ENGINEERING

The Dahl 15-11H was spud on October 14, 2011 by Extreme 18. A 13 %” hole was drilled with
fresh water to 2,133’ and cased with 9 %” casing cemented to surface. A Hughes 8 %” PDC bit
was used to drill the first part of the vertical. This assembly was tripped out for a new bit and
motor at 9,366’. Gamma was also picked up at this time. The second assembly was also a
Hughes PDC bit. The vertical was drilled in 119.5 hrs. Diesel invert drilling fluid with a target
weight of 10.0 ppg was used to drill the vertical hole.

Ryan Drilling Technologies and Solutions provided the personnel and equipment for the
measurement while drilling (MWD) services as well as the night directional driller. Directional
drilling was supervised by the company men during the day. Throughout this project, steering
decisions were made through a combined effort of the directional drillers, MWD, and Sunburst

The top of the Bakken Formation [Mississippian-Devonian] was logged at 10,712’ TVD -8,585' SS
with sample returns of black carbonaceous and petroliferous shale typical of the Upper Shale
Member and characterized by very high gamma (255+ api) and elevated background gas of 800-
1,500 units.

The Middle Bakken was logged at 10,728’ TVD, -8,601' SS. Near the completion of curve
operations, below the Upper Bakken Shale and above the target zone, a medium to light gray
brown siltstone was observed with interbedded limestone. It was described as, blocky, earthy,
with common amounts of pyrite. Beneath the siltstone, the samples were medium to light gray
with common white to off white. They were fine grained, friable, sub angular, and calcite
cemented. Samples also contained varying amounts of pyrite and oi! staining. Oil staining was
most prevalent in this zone often increasing from spotty to even oil staining. Gas values often
increased in the upper portion of the preferred porosity. These samples correlated with a ratty
gamma signature ranging from 65-80 api counts.

The center of the preferred porosity zone was marked by lower gamma values as low as 40 api
that typically correlated with cleaner and more calcareous samples. This zone ranged from 3-5’
thick. Often these samples contained lesser amounts of pyrite. In the lower half of target samples
were light to medium brown and gray samples typically containing /ess oil staining. At the base of
target was a “ratty” cool signature which ranged from 45-60 api that was attributed to stringers of
cleaner, heavily calcite-cemented sandstone. Below the target interval drill cuttings observed
showed diminished oil staining and were darker in color. Gamma counts increased as the well
bore dropped in formation correlating with the darker coloring of silty sandstone.

Perhaps the most perplexing portion of the well was at 15,000’. The wellbore traveled from
gamma and samples that correlated with being below the preferred porosity to gamma values
and samples that were indicative of being in the upper half of target. In this transition the cool
“ratty” gamma just above the base of target was likely faulted out.

Gas values increased from below 300 units until 12,582’ where a possible fracture increased gas
values to 300+ units. Around 15,000’ gas values began to greatly increase to 500-800 units with
shows as high as 1,200+ units. This is likely through a combined effort of being higher in the
preferred porosity and the possible and subsequent fracture seen at 15,000’. After 16,200’ the
wellbore began to drop in formation and as a result gas values fell back to 500-800 units with few
gas shows reaching 1,000+ units.

From 17,220’ to TD samples were compromised as a result of large amounts of lubricant used.

Consulting contractors, assisted by continual communication. A Security FXD55M PDC was used
at a kick-off point (KOP) of 10,286’. After drilling the curve in 19.5 hours, intermediate casing was
set at 10,952 measured depth (MD).

Once casing was set lateral operations began. Two assemblies were used to drill the lateral both
utilizing Hughes DP505FX PDC bits in front of Ryan motors. The first assembly was replaced at
11,044’ after an MWD tool failure. This assembly drilled 62’ in 1 hour. Following the trip in for the
MWD failure the rig experienced difficulties with the draw works. Parts were shipped for repair
and Sunburst Geologists were placed on stand bye until the parts returned. This cost ten days of
rig downtime and an extra day on top of that to trip for a new BHA. The second assembly
successfully reached TD drilling 9,806’ in 168 hrs. Bottom Hole Location: 10,148.96' N & 86.49’ W

GEOLOGY

Methods

Sunburst Consulting, Inc provided on site geologic representation for Dahl 15-11H. Drilling
parameters such as depth, drilling rate, pump strokes and total gas were broadcast on location
through Pason’s electronic data recorder system. The gas was linked from Sunburst's digital gas
chromatograph. Hydrocarbon constituents (C;—-C,) are expressed in part-per-million
concentrations. The chromatograph is fed by 1/4” polyflow from an agitation system set up at the
shakers. Under the instruction of Sunburst geologists, rig crews collected lagged samples in 30’
intervals. Intermediate samples were also collected during intervals requiring extra scrutiny. Rock
cuttings were analyzed in wet and dry conditions under a 10x45 power binocular microscope (for
detailed lithologic descriptions see appendix). Cuttings were sent to SM Energy and the North
Dakota Geological Survey. Along with sample lithology, MWD gamma ray data and rate of
penetration (ROP) were used to assist in landing the curve as well as steer through the lateral.

Lithology and Hydrocarbon Show

Sample analysis began at 8,340’ MD in the Charles Formation [Mississippian Madison Group].
Samples were interbedded salt, anhydrite, and limestone. No gas or oil shows were observed.

The Base of the Last Salt was logged at 9,226' TVD -7,099' SS. The Ratcliffe interval was logged
at 9,286' TVD -7,159' SS based on returns of limestone with trace algal material and traces of
anhydrite. The Ratcliffe interval had one gas show of 24.8 units.

The Mission Canyon Formation [Mississippian Madison Group] was logged at 9,446’ TVD -7,319'
SS. Typical lithologies were tan to light brown and grayish brown, occasional dark brown,
microcrystalline lime mudstone and wackestone with minor interbedded anhydrite. Several gas
shows were recorded in the Mission Canyon from 30 to 70 units increasing with depth.
Intermittent traces of spotty brown oil staining were observed in samples. Background gas held
from 20-40 units.

The Lodgepole Formation [Mississippian Madison Group] was encountered at 10,018 TVD -
7,891' SS. This interval contained brown to tan, white to off white argillaceous lime mudstone and
wackestone. This facies was microcrystalline and earthy in texture, with varying amounts of
pyrite. Background gas increased throughout the vertical from 25 to 40+ units depleting to 20+
units after the trip for curve assembly. At a measured depth of 10,598’ a possible fracture greatly
increased background gas to 100+ units. Another possible fracture at 10,836’ near the top of
Scallion interval raised background gas 800+ units with shows as high as 2,271 units, trace
amounts of spotty brown oil stain were observed.

Gas tracking and visible oil show in both cuttings and over the shakers were monitored to assist
in evaluating the viability of the reservoir. No oil was observed at the shakers throughout the
lateral. Greater amounts of oil staining was observed in the upper half of the preferred porosity
zone which varied from trace to common spotty to even brown oil stain.

While drilling the lateral it was found that just below the preferred porosity zone was the ideal
place to drill. Favorable drilling speeds allowed the wellbore to rotate at 120+ ft/hnr and a gentle
upward rotation minimized the need to slide. The cool gamma at the center of target and the ratty

gamma at the base of target were difficult to drill and often the wellbore deflected when coming
into these areas. This made slides more frequent within the preferred porosity. Underneath the
preferred porosity this deflection often was anticipated and allowed for smaller slides to keep the
wellbore tracking with dip. Geo-steering was successful in maintaining well bore exposure to the
Middle Bakken 100% of the lateral. The overall apparent dip was at 0.03 down.

SUMMARY

Dahl 15-11H was spud on October 14, 2011. The vertical was drilled using two PDC bits in 119.5
hrs and the curve was drilled in 19.5 hrs. The most favorable place to be in the Middle Bakken
due to higher oil staining, gas shows, ability to alleviate slides, and favorable drilling speeds was
just below the preferred porosity zone. Samples contaminated with lubricant made correlations
based on samples difficult later in the lateral. Oil shows consisted of common to rare, spotty-even
brown oil stain observed in sample. The lateral was drilled in 169 hrs. One trip at 11,044’ was the
result of a failed MWD tool. Third party personnel were put on stand-by after issues with the rig’s
draw works caused a down time issue in excess of a week. The total depth was at 20,850’ MD
on November 18, 2011 at 1:20 am. CST. The SM Energy Dahl 15-11H awaits completion
operations to determine its ultimate production potential.

LITHOLOGY

Rig crews caught lagged samples in 30’ intervals under the supervision of Sunburst geologists. A detailed
list of sampling intervals is included in the well data summary page. Sample or gamma ray marker tops
have been inserted in the sample descriptions below for reference. Samples were examined wet and dry
under a binocular microscope. The drilling fluid was diesel-based invert from surface casing to 10,982".
The drilling fluid was saltwater from 10,982’ to TD sample collection began at 9,120’.

SWSE Section 11-153N-101W
McKenzie County
Well File # 21266

Dear RANDY:

Pursuant to Commission Order No. 14938, approval to drill the above captioned well is hereby given. The
approval is granted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than
the 200' setback from the north & south boundaries and 1220' setback (per Commission policy) from the east
& west boundaries within the 1280 acre drilling unit consisting of Sections 2 & 11-T153N-R101W.

PERMIT STIPULATIONS: PRECAUTIONS MUST BE TAKEN WHILE DESIGNING THE FRAC
JOB FOR THE DAHL 15-11H WELL AS TO NOT ADVERSELY AFFECT THE SM ENERGY
LINDVIG 1-11HR WELL. Due to river adjacent to the well site, a dike is required surrounding the
entire location. Also, a Closed Mud System may be required, although the disposal of drill cuttings is
contingent upon site specific conditions to be determined by an NDIC Field Inspector. SM ENERGY
CO must contact NDIC Field Inspector Kevin Connors at 701-220-5989 prior to location construction.

Location Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period)

Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the
approved drilling permit on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report. If circumstances require operations to
commence before the 3rd business day following publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may
be waived by the Director. Application for a waiver must be by sworn affidavit providing the information
necessary to evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(, and any other
information that would allow the Director to conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the
drilling permit, the applicant should retain the permit.

Permit Fee & Notification

Payment was received in the amount of $100 via credit card. It is requested that notification be given
immediately upon the spudding of the well. This information should be relayed to the Oil & Gas Division,
Bismarck, via telephone. The following information must be included: Well name, legal location, permit number,
drilling contractor, company representative, date and time of spudding. Office hours are 8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m.
and 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. Central Time. Our telephone number is (701) 328-8020, leave a message if after hours

Survey Requirements for Horizontal, Horizontal Re-entry, and Directional Wells
NDAC Section 43-02-03-25 (Deviation Tests and Directional Surveys) states in part (that) the survey
contractor shall file a certified copy of all surveys with the director free of charge within thirty days of completion.
Surveys must be submitted as one electronic copy, or in a form approved by the director. However, the director
may require the directional survey to be filed immediately after completion if the survey is needed to conduct the
operation of the director's office in a timely manner. Certified surveys must be submitted via email in one adobe
document, with a certification cover page to certsurvey@nd.gov.

Survey points shall be of such frequency to accurately determine the entire location of the well bore.

Confidential status

Your request for confidential status of all information furnished to the Director, or his representatives, is
hereby granted. Such information, except production runs, shall remain confidential for six months commencing
on the date the well is spud.

Confidential status notwithstanding, the Director and his representatives shall have access to all well
records wherever located. Your company personnel, or any person performing work for your company shall
permit the Director and his representatives to come upon any lease, property, well, or drilling rig operated or
controlled by them, complying with all safety rules, and to inspect the records and operation of such wells and to
have access at all times to any and all records of wells. The Commission's field personnel periodically inspect
producing and drilling wells. Any information regarding such wells shall be made available to them at any time
upon request. The information so obtained by the field personnel shall be maintained in strict confidence and
shall be available only to the Commission and its staff.

Drilling pit
Please be advised approval for use of a drilling reserve pit or drill cuttings pit on this site is contingent on
site specific conditions and special pit closure requirements may apply.

Surface casing cement

Tail cement utilized on surface casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi within 12
hours, and tail cement utilized on production casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi
before drilling the plug or initiating tests.

Logs

NDAC Section 43-02-03-31 requires the running of a Cement Bond Log from which the presence of
cement can be determined in every well in which production or intermediate casing has been set and a Gamma
Ray Log must be run from total depth to ground level elevation of the well bore. All logs must be submitted as
one paper copy and one digital copy in LAS (Log ASCII) format, or a format approved by the Director. Image
logs that include, but are not limited to, Mud Logs, Cement Bond Logs, and Cyberlook Logs, cannot be produced
in their entirety as LAS (Log ASCII) files. To create a solution and establish a standard format for industry to
follow when submitting image logs, the Director has given approval for the operator to submit an image log as a
TIFF (*.tif) formatted file. The TIFF (*.tif) format will be accepted only when the log cannot be produced in its
entirety as a LAS (Log ASCII) file format. The digital copy may be submitted on a standard CD, or attached to an
email sent to digitallogs@nd.gov Thank you for your cooperation.

Sincerely,

David Tabor

NOTE: A Gamma Ray log must be run to ground surface and a CBL must be run on intermediate or longstring casing string if set.

Surveys are required at least every 30 feet in the build section and every 90 feet in the lateral section of a horizontal well. Measurement
inaccuracies are not considered when determining compliance with the spacing/drilling unit boundary setback requirement except in the
following scenarios: 1) When the angle between the well bore and the respective boundary is 10 degrees or less; or 2) If Industry standard
methods and equipment are not utilized. Consult the applicable field order for exceptions.

If measurement inaccuracies are required to be considered, a 2° MWD measurement inaccuracy will be applied to the horizontal portion of the well
bore. This measurement inaccuracy is applied to the well bore from KOP to TD.

REQUIRED ATTACHMENTS: Certified surveyor's plat, horizontal section plat, estimated geological tops, proposed mud/cementing plan,

directional plot/plan, $100 fee.
