North Dakota.

INTRODUCTION

The Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC Kline Federal 5300 31-18 15T [Lot 3 Section 18,
T153N, R1OO0W] is located in Baker Field of the Williston Basin in western North Dakota. This
section lies approximately 7 miles south of the town of Williston and adjacent to Lake
Sakakawea in McKenzie County. The Kline Federal 5300 31-18 15T is a horizontal First Bench
Three Forks well, in a double-section, laydown spacing unit permitted to drill to the east from
the surface location within Section 18, continuing through Section 17 to the proposed bottom-
hole location (PBHL) in that section. There are 200’ setbacks along the north and south borders
and 500’ setbacks from the east and west borders within the 1,280 acre spacing unit. The well
consists of one Three Forks lateral. The vertical hole was planned to be drilled to approximately
10,293’. The curve would be built at 12 degrees per 100’ to land within the First Bench Three
Forks. Directional drilling technologies and geo-steering techniques were used to land in the
Three Forks reservoir and maintain exposure to the ideal target rock. Oasis Petroleum is
targeting a dolomite shale facies of the Three Forks Formation with intent to intersect porosity
and fracture trends enhancing reservoir quality.

The Pronghorn Member [Devonian-Bakken Formation] was reached at 10,876' MD 10,740' TVD
(-8,707' SS). Entry into this interval was characterized by lower gamma, and slightly slower
penetration rates. Samples from the Pronghorn were described as siltstone which was dark gray
trace gray black and friable to firm. This siltstone was moderately dolomite cemented and
included disseminated and nodular pyrite. Also noted was a trace of spotty light brown oil stain.
Drilling gas in this interval reached a maximum of 250 units.

The Three Forks [Devonian] was reached at 10,916' MD 10,754' TVD (-8,721' SS) which was -
16’ high to the Oasis Petroleum North America LLC Chalmers 5300 21-19 8T. The target zone
of the Three Forks was to be drilled in a predominately 16 foot zone beginning 12 feet into the
Three Forks and representing the 1** Bench.

Samples in the Three Forks were predominantly dolomite which was described as light brown-
light brown gray, tan-cream, trace pink in color. It was firm, laminated, with a microsucrosic
texture. Rare disseminated pyrite was noted as was occasional intercrystalline porosity. Also
noted was common spotty to rare even light brown oil stain. Also observed was light green-light
gray green, mint green shale that was firm, sub blocky, with an earthy texture. Occasional
disseminated pyrite was noted as was possible intergranular porosity.

Hydrocarbon Shows

Gas monitoring and fluid gains provided evidence of a hydrocarbon saturated reservoir during
the drilling of the Kline Federal 5300 31-18 15T. Oil and gas shows at the shakers and in
samples were continuously monitored. In the closed mud system, hydrostatic conditions were
maintained near balance, this allowed for gas and fluid gains from the well to be evaluated. Gas
varied according to stratigraphic position and penetration rates which may have reflected
increased porosity. During the vertical, gas peaks of 42 to 301 units were noted, against a 9.7-
10.4 ppg diesel-invert mud weight. Background concentrations in the lateral ranged from 132 to
1,895 units, against a 9.6-9.65 lb/gal saltwater gel drilling fluid. Chromatography of gas revealed
typical concentrations of methane, characteristic of First Bench Three Forks gas.

Geosteering

Ryan Energy Technologies provided personnel and equipment for measurement-while-drilling
(MWD) services. The RPM directional drillers, MWD, and Sunburst Consulting personnel
worked closely together throughout the project to evaluate data and make steering decisions to
maximize the amount of borehole in the targeted zones and increase rate of penetration (ROP) of
the formation.

OFFSET WELLS

Offset well data used for depth correlation during curve operations are found in the ‘Control
Data’ section appended to this report. Offset well control was essential in providing control data,
making it possible to develop a prognosis of formation tops and landing target depth. By
referencing the gamma signature of these offsets, a model was formed for the target interval
pinpointing a strategic landing. Formation thicknesses expressed by gamma ray signatures in
these wells were compared to gamma data collected during drilling operations in order to
successfully land the curve. The target landing true vertical depth (TVD) was periodically
updated during drilling to ensure accurate landing of the curve.

GEOLOGY

The Mission Canyon Formation [Mississippian Madison Group] was logged 9,391' MD 9,390'
TVD (-7,357' SS). The Mission Canyon Formation consisted of a lime mudstone that was
described as light gray, light brown to brown, gray brown, trace dark gray in color. The lime
mudstone was predominately friable to firm, with an earthy to rare crystalline texture. Some
intervals contained a trace of black-brown algal material, traces of fossil fragments, and traces of
disseminated pyrite. Also present was an argillaceous lime mudstone that was described as light
gray, occasional medium gray, rare gray tan, rare off white, trace dark gray in color. The
argillaceous lime mudstone was predominately firm to friable, crystalline to chalky texture.
Some intervals contained a trace of disseminated pyrite. The highest gas shows were 71 to 112
units and 53 units of connection gas in the Mission Canyon. Rare intercrystalline porosity was
noted as well as trace spotty light brown oil stain while logging the Mission Canyon Formation.

The Upper Bakken Shale Member [Mississippian-Bakken Formation] was drilled at 10,737' MD
10,671' TVD (-8,638' SS). Entry into this member was characterized by high gamma, elevated
background gas and increased rates of penetration. The black to black gray carbonaceous and
petroliferous shale was hard with a sub blocky to sub platy texture. Fracture porosity was noted,
and trace minerals were observed including disseminated pyrite and calcite fracture fill.
Hydrocarbons evaluated in this interval reached a maximum of 367 units of drilling gas.

The Middle Bakken Member [Mississippian-Devonian Bakken Formation] was drilled at 10,766'
MD 10,687' TVD (-8,654' SS) which was 9’ high to the Oasis Petroleum North America LLC
Chalmers 5300 21-19 8T. Samples in the Middle Bakken Member were predominantly silty
sandstone which was described as light gray brown, light brown, trace light gray in color. It was
very fine grained, friable, subrounded, smooth, moderately sorted, and moderately calcite
cemented. A trace of disseminated and nodular pyrite was noted as was fair intergranular
porosity. Also noted was common light to medium brown spotty to even oil stain. Hydrocarbons
evaluated in this interval reached a maximum of 292 units of drilling gas.

The Lower Bakken Shale Member [Mississippian-Bakken Formation] was drilled at 10,850' MD
10,729' TVD (-8,696' SS). Entry into this interval was characterized by high gamma, elevated
background gas and increased rates of penetration. The carbonaceous black, black gray shale is
petroliferous, hard, splintery, smooth and exhibits possible fracture porosity. Trace minerals
included disseminated pyrite. Drilling gas in this interval reached a maximum of 339 units.

SUMMARY

The Kline Federal 5300 31-18 15T is a successful well in Oasis Petroleum’s horizontal 1*t Bench
Three Forks development program in Baker Field. The project was drilled from surface casing to
TD in a little over 17 days. The TD of 20,542’ MD was achieved at 17:15 hours CDT May 7,
2015. The well site team worked together to maintain the well bore in the desired target interval
for 100% of the lateral, opening 9,447’ of potentially productive reservoir rock.

Samples in the First Bench Three Forks were predominantly dolomite which was described as
light brown-light brown gray, tan-cream, trace pink in color. It was firm, laminated, with a
microsucrosic texture. Rare disseminated pyrite was noted as was occasional intercrystalline
porosity. Also noted was common spotty to rare even light brown oil stain. Also observed was
light green-light gray green, mint green shale that was firm, sub blocky, with an earthy texture.
Occasional disseminated pyrite was noted as was possible intergranular porosity.

Gas on the Kline Federal 5300 31-18 I5T varied according to stratigraphic position and
penetration rates which may have reflected increased porosity. The overall gas and hydrocarbon
shows were encouraging and indicate a hydrocarbon rich system in the Three Forks.

The Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC. Kline Federal 5300 31-18 15T awaits completion
operations to determine its ultimate production potential.

The 920’ curve was drilled in 24 hours, circulating time. The assembly used to complete the
curve consisted of bit #5; a Security MMD55M PDC bit, attached to a 2.38 degree fixed NOV
stage 7/8 5.0 motor and MWD tools. The curve was successfully landed at 11,120’ MD and
10,772’ TVD, approximately 18’ into the Three Forks. Seven inch diameter 32# HCP-110
intermediate casing was set to 11,095’ MD.

Geologic structure maps of the Kline Federal 5300 31-18 15T and surrounding control wells had
estimated gross formation dip to be down at approximately 0.2°. The preferred drilling interval
consisted of a thirteen foot zone of dolomite and shale and a 3’ zone of Claystone located
approximately twelve feet into the Three Forks. Penetration rates, gas shows, gamma ray data,
and sample observations were utilized to keep the wellbore in the preferred stratigraphic position
in the target zone. Using offset well data provided by Oasis representatives, projected porosity
zones were identified in the preferred drilling areas.

Target Definition: Kline Federal 5300 31-18 15T

Offset well target definition for the Three Forks 1‘ Bench, Indian Hills Prospect (Oasis).

Steering decisions were made by using the low gamma in the lower portion of the target zone to
establish the well-bore’s position in the target zone. If the well-bore moved lower, the higher
gamma of the underlying claystone (G) was observed, as was the presence of claystone in
collected samples. Slides were then utilized to move the well-bore back up into the target zone.
As the well-bore moved higher, approaching the top of the target zone the high to medium
fluctuating gamma (D) was noted. Samples in the lower gamma portion of the target zone
contained noticeably greater concentrations of the light brown-light brown gray, tan-cream, trace
pink dolomite; as the well-bore moved higher in zone the samples tended to have more of the
light gray, off white, gray brown dolomite. This lateral was drilled in 4 and a half days from
casing exit to TD, with two lateral assemblies. The TD of 20,542’ MD was achieved at 17:15
hours CDT May 7, 2015. The wellbore was completed with 100% of the lateral in target,

LITHOLOGY

Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC
Kline Federal 5300 31-18 15T

Rig crews caught 100’ sample intervals, under the supervision of Sunburst geologists, from 4,700’ to
8,240’; 30° intervals from 8,240’, to the TD of the lateral at 20,542’. Formation tops and lithologic
markers have been inserted into the sample descriptions below for reference. Sample descriptions begin
in the Belle Fourche Formation. Samples were examined wet and dry under a binocular microscope.
Sample fluorescent cuts are masked by invert mud through intermediate casing. Quantifiers in order of
increasing abundance are trace, rare, occasional, common and abundant.

RE: HORIZONTAL WELL
KLINE FEDERAL 5300 31-18 15T
LOTS3 Section 18-153N-100W
McKenzie County
Well File # 30789

Dear Victoria:

Pursuant to Commission Order No. 23752, approval to drill the above captioned well is hereby given. The
approval is granted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than
the 500' setback from the north & south boundaries and 200' setback from the east & west boundaries within the
1280 acre spacing unit consisting of Sections 17 & 18 T153N R100W.

PERMIT STIPULATIONS: Effective June 1, 2014, a covered leak-proof container (with placard) for
filter sock disposal must be maintained on the well site beginning when the well is spud, and must
remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations are
conducted. OASIS PETRO NO AMER must contact NDIC Field Inspector Richard Dunn at 701-770-
3554 prior to location construction. Due to surficial water adjacent to the well site, a dike is required
surrounding the entire location.

Drilling pit

NDAC 43-02-03-19.4 states that “a pit may be utilized to bury drill cuttings and solids generated during well
drilling and completion operations, providing the pit can be constructed, used and reclaimed in a manner that will
prevent pollution of the land surface and freshwaters. Reserve and circulation of mud system through earthen pits
are prohibited. All pits shall be inspected by an authorized representative of the director prior to lining and use.
Drill cuttings and solids must be stabilized in a manner approved by the director prior to placement in a cuttings

pit.”

Form 1 Changes & Hard Lines

Any changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC.
The proposed directional plan is at a legal location. Based on the azimuth of the proposed lateral the maximum
legal coordinate from the well head is: 10108 E.

Location Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period)

Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the
approved drilling permit on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report. If circumstances require operations to
commence before the 3rd business day following publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may
be waived by the Director. Application for a waiver must be by sworn affidavit providing the information
necessary to evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f, and any other
information that would allow the Director to conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the
drilling permit, the applicant should retain the permit.

DETAILS OF WORK

Oasis Petroleum North America LLC (OPNA) requests permission for suspension of drilling for up to 90 days for the
referenced well under NDAC 43-02-03-55. OPNA intends to drill the surface hole with freshwater based drilling mud
and set surface casing with a small driliing rig and move off within 3 to 5 days. The casing will be set at a depth
pre-approved by the NDIC per the Application for Permit to Drill NDAC 43-02-03-21. No saltwater will be used in the
drilling and cementing operations of the surface casing. Once the surface casing is cemented, a plug or mechanical
seal will be placed at the top of the casing to prevent any foreign matter from getting into the well. A rig capable of
drilling to TD will move onto the location within the 90 days previously outlined to complete the drilling and casing
plan as per the APD. The undersigned states that this request for suspension of drilling operations in accordance
with the Subsection 4 of Section 43-02-03-55 of the NDAC, is being requested to take advantage of the cost savings
and time savings of using an initial rig that is smaller than the rig necessary to drill a well to total depth but is not
intended to alter or extend the terms and conditions of, or suspend any obligation under, any oil and gas lease with
acreage in or under the spacing or driiling unit for the above-referenced well. OPNA understands NDAC 43-02-03-31
requirements regarding confidentiality pertaining to this permit. The dritiing pit wiil be fenced immediately, as site
conditions ailow, after construction if the weil pad is located in a pasture (NDAC 43-02-03-19 & 19.1). OPNA will
notify the NDIC and work on an alternative soiution if unforeseen circumstances prevent the rig from returning to
drili prior to the 90 extension expiration.

RE: Filter Socks and Other Filter Media
Leakproof Container Required
Oil and Gas Wells

Dear Operator,

North Dakota Administrative Code Section 43-02-03-19.2 states in part that all waste material associated with
exploration or production of oil and gas must be properly disposed of in an authorized facility in accord with all
applicable local, state, and federal laws and regulations.

Filtration systems are commonly used during oil and gas operations in North Dakota. The Commission is very
concerned about the proper disposal of used filters (including filter socks) used by the oil and gas industry.

Effective June 1, 2014, a container must be maintained on each well drilled in North Dakota beginning when the
well is spud and must remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations
are conducted. The on-site container must be used to store filters until they can be properly disposed of in an
authorized facility. Such containers must be:

e leakproof to prevent any fluids from escaping the container

e covered to prevent precipitation from entering the container

e placard to indicate only filters are to be placed in the container

If the operator will not utilize a filtration system, a waiver to the container requirement will be considered, but
only upon the operator submitting a Sundry Notice (Form 4) justifying their request.

As previously stated in our March 13, 2014 letter, North Dakota Administrative Code Section 33-20-02.1-01
states in part that every person who transports solid waste (which includes oil and gas exploration and production
wastes) is required to have a valid permit issued by the North Dakota Department of Health, Division of Waste
Management. Please contact the Division of Waste Management at (701) 328-5166 with any questions on the
solid waste program. Note oil and gas exploration and production wastes include produced water, drilling mud,
invert mud, tank bottom sediment, pipe scale, filters, and fly ash.

Thank you for your cooperation.

Sincerely,

Brace E. Fichs
