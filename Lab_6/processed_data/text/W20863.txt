INTRODUCTION

Oasis Petroleum North America LLC, Inc. Foley Federal 42-12H [SW SE Section 12,
T153N, R101W] is located approximately 10 miles south of Williston in McKenzie County,
North Dakota. The Foley Federal 5301 43-12H is a horizontal Middle Bakken well within the
Williston Basin consisting of one ~9,425’ long lateral drilled towards the north (360°). The
vertical hole was drilled to a depth of 10,257’ measured depth (MD). Plans called for a
12°/100’ built rate in the curve to ensure landing within the Middle Bakken silty sandstone.
To isolate the targeted reservoir and meet legal requirements, intermediate casing was set
after drilling to 11,015’ MD (Figure 2). After intermediate casing had been set, directional
drilling and geo-steering techniques were employed to maintain maximum exposure to the
target reservoir.

OFFSET WELLS

Similar offset wells were used as primary controls while drilling the Foley Federal 5301 43-
12H. They were the Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC. Bray 5301 43-12H [SW SE Sec.
12, T153N, R101W], located 100’ west of the subject well; SM Energy Company Lindvig 1-
11HR [SE SE Sec. 11, T153N, R101 W], located 0.8 miles west of the subject well; and the
SM Energy Company Rosebud 22-11 [SE NW Sec. 11, T153N, R101 W], located 1.45 miles
northwest of the subject well (Figure 3). The above wells were selected based on their
proximity to the subject well. Data including rate of penetration (ROP), and lagged samples
were used to determine marker and formation tops during the vertical hole. MWD gamma
ray data was utilized during the curve build and lateral sections. During both the vertical and
curve-build sections, tops were compared to primary offset wells to ensure successful landing
within the target zone. The true vertical depth (TVD) of the landing target was calculated by
assuming comparable formation thicknesses to the closest offset wells, the Bray 530] 43-
12H and Lindvig 1-11HR. Target was adjusted as necessary until landing (Table 1).

The Oasis Petroleum North America LLC, Inc. Foley Federal 5301 43-12H was spud on
August 27, 201 land surface casing was pre-set at 2,085’ MD. On September 13, 2011 an 8
%” Smith PDC MDSI616 bit (bit #2) was used in front of a 1.5° fixed mud motor to re-enter
the vertical hole with 5S” drill pipe. This assembly drilled 8,157’ to kick-off point (KOP) at
10,257’ MD in 97 hours using diesel invert drilling fluid with a density of 9.5-9.9 pounds per
gallon (ppg). KOP was reached at 13:30 hours CDT September 15, 2011.

Ls

Curve building started September 16, 2011 at 10,257’ MD. Diesel invert drilling fluid
fluctuated in density between 10.3 and 10.5 ppg. The curve was drilled with a Security PDC
FXD5S5M bit, (bit #3), in front of a 2.5° fixed mud motor. Drilling progressed efficiently with
this assembly until total depth (TD) of the curve was reached at 11,015’ MD at 0900 CDT on
September 17, 2011. The bottom hole assembly (BHA) included a Professional Directional
MWD tool that recorded survey and gamma ray data. The wellbore successfully penetrated
the Middle Bakken silty sandstone target at 10,976’ MD (10,732’ TVD, -8,641” MSL). The
drill string and BHA were tripped out of the hole while laying down the 5” drill pipe using a
lay-down crew. Casing operations were performed by Wyoming Casing Services Inc. The 7”
intermediate casing consisted of 208 joints of 294 HCP-110 and 66 joints of 324 HCP-110.
Cementing operations were performed by Schlumberger.

—_

After intermediate casing procedures were completed, 4” drill pipe was picked up, diesel
invert drilling fluid was replaced with salt water drilling fluid which fluctuated in density
from 9.2-9.5+ ppg throughout the lateral. Bit #4, a 6” Security PDC FX64 was run in front
of a 1.5° fixed motor. Dmiling progressed efficiently until 12,417’ MD when the wellbore
encountered the Upper Bakken Shale after a violent bounce upward where two downward
slides did not remediate the ascension of the bit. The decision was made to open-hole
sidetrack starting at 12,041” MD. The first attempt at sidetracking was successful; however
the MWD tool failed necessitating a trip. The mud motor was replaced with another 1.5°
fixed motor in front of a 6” Secunty PDC FX64, (bit #5). Drilling progressed until the
inclination took another bounce up and another Upper Bakken Shale strike occurred at
14,603’ MD. The decision was made for another open-hole sidetrack starting at 13,940’ MD.
The first attempt at sidetracking failed due to the ledge having collapsed. The second attempt
at sidetracking was successful. Drilling progressed efficiently with this assembly until a

GEOLOGY
Methods

Two well-site geologists contracted by Sunburst Consulting Inc. conducted the geologic
analysis for Foley Federal 5301 43-12H. Sunburst installed and monitored a digital gas
detector and chromatograph interfaced with a Pason Electronic Data Recording System
(EDR). The EDR provided depth, drilling rate and pump stroke data to the M-Controller gas-
monitoring software which returned gas data in the form of total gas units and hydrocarbon
constituent (methane, ethane, propane, butane) concentrations expressed in parts-per-million.
Gas samples were pulled through 4” poly-flow tubing after agitation in Sunburst’s gas trap
installed in the possum belly. Rig crews caught lagged samples under the supervision of
well-site geologists in 30’ intervals from 8,240’ to 10,820’; 10’ intervals from 10,820’ to
11,020’; 30’ intervals from 11,020’ to 20,440’ TD. Wet and dry cuttings were examined
under a binocular microscope, complete lithologic descriptions are provided in this
evaluation. Cuttings were also evaluated for hydrocarbon “cut” by immersion in Entron and
inspected under a UV fluoroscope until samples became contaminated with lateral lubricant
at approximately 14,600’ MD. One set of dry cuttings were collected and sent to the North
Dakota Geological Survey Core Library.

Lithology

Geologic evaluation began at 8,240’ in orange to orange brown siltstone with trace amount of
white to off white sandstone in the Mississippian Kibbey Formation (Big Snowy Group).

The Kibbey “Lime” Marker was logged at 8,536’ TVD (-6,265 MSL, 1’ low to the Bray
5301 43-12H offset). The top of the Kibbey “Lime” was determined based off a decrease in
rate of penetration (ROP), due to a 14’ layer of anhydrite. Samples from this interval are
mostly light gray to brown lime mudstone with a crystalline texture. Below the Kibbey
“Lime” marker samples consist of interbedded white to off white calcareous shale and orange
brown to brown calcareous siltstone.

Unconformably below the Kibbey is the Mississippian Charles Formation (Madison Group).
Samples from this interval were primarily salt which was translucent to a milky white color
and typically consisted of firm to hard subhedral crystals, inter-bedded with argillaceous
limestone and anhydrite. The lime mudstone was firm to friable, crystalline and primarily
light to medium gray to gray-brown in color. The anhydrite was white, soft, and amorphous
in texture. The Charles Salt was logged here at 8,490’ TVD (-6,399’ MSL, 4’ high to Bray

Figure 4. Middle Bakken siltstone. Sample depth 10,930’ MD viewed under 20x magnification. (Kyle Kavalec,
Sunburst well-site geologist)

The second distinct lithology of the Middle Bakken Member was a fossiliferous limestone
(packstone) with a characteristically low gamma signature ~20 API units. It has a variable
thickness throughout the Williston Basin and lies directly below the siltstone; however this
facies was absent in the Foley Federal 5301 43-12H.

The third lithology of the Middle Bakken Member is silty sandstone usually located below
the packstone. The lithologic description is a light gray to off white to cream with trace
medium gray silty sandstone that is very fine grained to fine grained. This silty sandstone is
moderately sorted with dolomite and calcite cements. In zone a spotty to even oil stain was
present.

The top of this zone exhibited a higher gamma signature than the bottom portion. At the top
1’-2’ of zone gamma signatures ranged from 100’s to 120’s. The middle 1’-2’ of the zone
exhibited a lower gamma count ~60 API units. The lower portion of zone displayed counts
in the 90’s to 100’s with very little character. The oil staining observed in sample displayed
similar concentrations throughout the target zone. Within the zone oil stain was described as
common to trace light brown spotty to even.

5301 43-12H offset). Intermittent salt beds were present until the Base Last Salt Marker
(Charles Formation), logged at 9,198° TVD (-7,107° MSL, 0’ to the Bray 5301 43-12H and
2’ low to the Lindvig 1-11HR offsets). Within the salts, the UB Marker was penetrated at
9,120’ TVD (-7,029’ MSL 6’ low to the Bray 5301 43-12H and 0’ to the Lindvig 1-11HR
offsets). The Ratcliffe interval is a lower member of the Charles Formation found below the
Base Last Salt. The Ratcliffe was logged at 9,230’ TVD (-7,139’ MSL 0’ to the Bray 5301
43-12H offset).

The Mission Canyon Formation (Mississippian Madison Group) was penetrated at 9,418’
TVD (-7,327 MSL, 2’ low to the Bray 5301 43-12H and 0’ to the Lindvig 1-11HR offsets).
This formation consists predominately of limestone with poor intercrystalline porosity and an
earthy texture. The lime mudstone is typically; medium to dark gray, microcrystalline, firm
and contained sections that are partially argillaceous. Trace quantities of anhydrite were also
observed, that were white to off white, soft and amorphous.

The Lodgepole Formation (Mississippian Madison Group) was encountered at 9,975° TVD (-
7,884’ MSL, 3’ high to the Bray 5301 43-12H and 3’ high to the Lindvig 1-11HR offsets).
The Lodgepole contain some limestone near the top of the formation, but is dominated
primarily by an argillaceous lime mudstone with common traces of pyrite. The limestone
samples observed were tan, light gray to cream, microcrystalline, earthy texture, and friable
to firm with no visible porosity is typically described as a light to medium gray to gray-
brown dense fossiliferous argillaceous limestone with some chert present.

The “False Bakken’ Marker (Mississippian Lodgepole Formation) was logged at 10,815'
MD, 10,692’ TVD (-8,601' MSL, 0’ to the Bray 5301 43-12H and 6’ low to the Lindvig 1-
11HR offsets) Typically, The False Bakken facies consisted of very dark gray carbonaceous
shale that is soft to friable with an earthy texture. There is usually common disseminated
pyrite and no visible porosity.

The Mississippian-Devonian Bakken Formation is comprised of two beds of black
carbonaceous petroliferous shale bounding a silty sandstone Middle Member with some
intergranular porosity. The Upper Shale Member was logged at 10,832’ MD, 10,703' TVD (-
8,612’ MSL, 0’ to the Bray 5301 43-12H and 9’ low to the Lindvig 1-11HR offsets). Sample
returns were black, carbonaceous and petroliferous shale with common disseminated pyrite
and characterized by gamma ray values in excess of ~300 API counts.

The Middle Bakken Member was logged at 10,876’ MD, 10,719' TVD (-8,628’ MSL, 0’ to
the Bray 5301 43-12H and 7’ low to the Lindvig 1-11HR offsets). This member is typically
comprised of three distinct lithologies. The first facies encountered was a siltstone
characterized by a high gamma signature. This lithology is located directly below the Upper
Shale Member. A typical description of this zone is a well to moderately sorted dark gray to
gray siltstone with possible intergranular porosity.

Hydrocarbon Shows

Background gas concentrations observed in the Middle Bakken lateral ranged from
approximately 400 units at the beginning of lateral with a 9.9 ppg mud weight and ~5,000
units towards the end of the lateral with an 10.5 ppg mud weight. Increased background gas
concentrations were most likely due to greater exposure of the wellbore to the target porosity
zone in addition to a lighter mud weight. The highest peak values were observed towards the
second half of the lateral while drilling in the upper portion of the target zone. The highest
peak value observed was 4,477 units at 17,252’ MD with a mud weight of 10.5 ppg.
Connection gases within the target zone averaged ~500-2,000 units in the beginning of the
lateral and increased to ~3,000-4,000 units towards the end. The highest connection gas
observed throughout the lateral was 1,539 units at 16,988’ MD. Gas was circulated through
the gas buster throughout the second half of the lateral following a 3,000 unit gas peak during
the middle of the lateral. The Middle Bakken trip gas was the highest trip gas value of 6,421
units observed throughout the well. Light brown spotty oil stain was observed throughout the
target zone lithology. Oil stained samples were immersed in Entron. The samples exhibited
predominantly moderate diffuse pale yellow to green fluorescence. As the samples became
contaminated with lateral lubricant they were not longer evaluated for hydrocarbon cut due to
fact that the lubricant fluid is hydrocarbon based which would cause false fluorescence in the
sample and thus give an inaccurate picture of the amount of hydrocarbons present within the
cuttings. Greenish brown oil was observed coming over the shakers the entire lateral.
Throughout the lateral sidetrack a 4-8’ intermittent flare was observed.

Geo-steering

Professional Directional provided well site supervision. Professional Directional was utilized
for directional drilling services and for MWD services. Oasis’ office in Houston, directional
drillers and Sunburst geologists worked closely throughout the well to make steering
decisions to maximize the amount of borehole exposure to the pay zone. The Middle Bakken
Member of the Foley Federal 5301 43-12H is estimated at ~36’ thick. The initial target
interval chosen for this well was located 7’ below the upper shale at 10,732’ TVD. After two
Upper Bakken Shale strikes from wild bounces near the top of the zone and the tendency of
the mud motor to build heavily in rotation our target interval dropped to 13’ below the Upper
Bakken Shale. This was for preventing anymore “hard streaks” from bouncing the wellbore
up and out of the zone. The original target zone was chosen based on density porosity logs
from other wells. Stratigraphic location within the target zone was based on gamma ray
values, sample observations, gas shows, and drill rates. Gamma signatures at the very top of
target zone ranged in value from ~100-120 API units. The middle of the target gamma
signatures were consistently in the 60’s. Upon descent into the lower portion of the target,
gamma values observed averaged ~90 API units with very little character. The lowest
gamma lithology was encountered when crossing the center target zone at roughly 12,226’
MD in the lateral. The presence of repeatable gamma markers provided excellent
mechanisms for steering. A dip calculation along the length of the well bore indicated an
overall 0.26° down formation apparent dip.

O 6) Hydrocarbon shows in the Middle Bakken were very common. Samples containing
oil stain fluoresced when immersed in Entron producing moderate to diffuse
becoming streaming green to yellow fluorescence. Gas shows reached a peak value
of ~4,477 units at 17,252’ MD.

7) Geo-steering was accomplished via sample evaluation and gamma markers. Dip
estimations were based on intersections with repeat markers by the well bore. Dip
projections were utilized to maintain contact between the well bore and the target
porosity zones.

8) The Foley Federal 5301 43-12H awaits completion operations to determine its
ultimate production potential.

Figure 7. Cross-sectional interpretation of the Foley Federal 5301 43-12H borehole based on lithology and
MWD gamma ray. The overall formation dip of 0.26° down resulted in a structural position at TD that was ~35’
O lower in TVD than initial contact with the target zone (Kyle Kavalec, Sunburst well-site geologist)

SUMMARY

1) The Oasis Petroleum North America LLC, Inc. Foley Federal 5301 43-12H is a
continuation of exploratory efforts in McKenzie County, North Dakota targeting the
Middle Bakken porosity within the Miss.-Devonian Bakken Formation

2) The well was spud on July 27, 2011 and re-entered September 13, 2011. The vertical
hole was drilled to a kick-off point of 10,257’ on September 15, 2011. Intermediate
casing was set at 10,995’ MD in preparation for lateral operations. Lateral drilling
operations concluded on October 6, 2011.

3) The lateral was drilled with four 6” PDC bits.

4) A diesel invert mud program was used through the vertical and curve. Salt water
drilling fluid was used for the remainder of drilling operations. The weight of both
fluids was (~9.5-10.6 ppg) to maintain hydrostatic balance.

5) Samples from the Middle Bakken porosity consisted of silty sandstone and very fine
grained to fine grained sandstone with dolomite and calcite cement in part.

DETAILS OF WORK
Oasis requests permission for suspension of drilling for up to 90 days for the referenced well under NDAC 43-02-03-
55. Oasis intends to drill the surface hole with freshwater based drilling mud and set surface casing with a small
drilling rig and move off within 3 to 5 days. The casing will be set at a depth pre-approved by the NDIC per the
Application for Permit to Drill NDAC 43-02-03-21. No saltwater will be used in the drilling and cementing operations of
the surface casing. Once the surface casing is cemented, a plug or mechanical seal will be placed at the top of the
casing to prevent any foreign matter from getting into the well. A rig capable of drilling to TD will move onto the
location within the 90 days previously outlined to complete the drilling and casing plan as per the APD. The
undersigned states that this request for suspension of drilling operations in accordance with the Subsection 4 of
Section 43-02-03-55 of the NDAC, is being requested to take advantage of the cost savings and time savings of using
an initial rig that is smaller than the rig necessary to drill a well to total depth but is not intended to alter or extend the
terms and conditions of, or suspend any obligation under, any oil and gas lease with acreage in or under the spacing
or drilling unit for the above-referenced well. Oasis understands NDAC 43-02-03-31 requirements regarding
confidentiality pertaining to this permit. The lined reserve pit will be fenced immediately after construction if the well
pad is located in a pasture (NDAC 43-02-03-19 & 19.1). Oasis will plug and abandon the well and reclaim the well site if
the well is not drilled by the larger rotary rig within 90 days after spudding the well with the smaller drilling rig.

Location: SWSE 12-153-101 County: MCKENZIE
Permit Type: Wildcat - HORIZONTAL
Field: WILDCAT Target Horizon: BAKKEN

Dear ROBIN E. HESKETH:

North Dakota Century Code (NDCC) Section 38-08-04 provides for the preservation of cores and samples and their
shipment to the State Geologist when requested. The following is required on the above referenced well:

1) All cores, core chips and samples must be submitted to the State Geologist as provided for the NDCC Section 38-
08-04 and North Dakota Administrative Code 43-02-03-38.1.

2) Samples shall include all cuttings from:

Base of the Last Charles Salt

Samples of cuttings shall be taken at 30' maximum intervals through all vertical, build and horizontal sections.
Samples must be washed, dried, packed in sample envelopes in correct order with labels showing operator, well
name, location and depth, and forwarded in standard boxes to the State Geologist within 30 days of the
completion of drilling operations.

3) Cores: ALL CORES cut shall be preserved in correct order, properly boxed, and forwarded to the State Geologist
within 90 days of completion of drilling operations. Any extension of time must have written approval from the
State Geologist.

4) All cores, core chips, and samples must be shipped, prepaid, to the State Geologist at the following address:

ND Geological Survey Core Library
Campus Road and Cornell
Grand Forks, ND 58202

5) NDCC Section 38-08-16 allows for a civil penalty for any violation of Chapter 38 08 not to exceed $12,500 for
each offense, and each day’s violation is a separate offense.

Sincerely

Survey Requirements for Horizontal, Horizontal Re-entry, and Directional Wells

NDAC Section 43-02-03-25 (Deviation Tests and Directional Surveys) states in part (that) the survey contractor
shall file a certified copy of all surveys with the director free of charge within thirty days of completion. Surveys
must be submitted as one electronic copy, or in a form approved by the director. However, the director may
require the directional survey to be filed immediately after completion if the survey is needed to conduct the
operation of the director's office in a timely manner. Certified surveys must be submitted via email in one adobe
document, with a certification cover page to certsurvey@nd.gov.

Survey points shall be of such frequency to accurately determine the entire location of the well bore.

Reserve pit
Please be advised that conditions may be imposed on the use and reclamation of a drilling reserve pit on
this site if specific site conditions warrant.

Surface casing cement

Tail cement utilized on surface casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi within 12
hours, and tail cement utilized on production casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi
before drilling the plug or initiating tests.

Logs

NDAC Section 43-02-03-31 requires the running of a Cement Bond Log from which the presence of
cement can be determined in every well in which production or intermediate casing has been set and a Gamma
Ray Log must be run from total depth to ground level elevation of the well bore. All logs must be submitted as
one paper copy and one digital copy in LAS (Log ASCII) format, or a format approved by the Director. Image
logs that include, but are not limited to, Mud Logs, Cement Bond Logs, and Cyberlook Logs, cannot be produced
in their entirety as LAS (Log ASCI)) files. To create a solution and establish a standard format for industry to
follow when submitting image logs, the Director has given approval for the operator to submit an image log as a
TIFF (*.tif) formatted file. The TIFF (*.tif) format will be accepted only when the log cannot be produced in its
entirety as a LAS (Log ASCII) file format. The digital copy may be submitted on a 3.5” floppy diskette, a standard
CD, or attached to an email sent to digitallogs@nd.gov
Thank you for your cooperation.

Dear Brandi :

Pursuant to Commission Order No. 14007, approval to drill the above captioned well is hereby given. The
approval is granted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than
the 200' setback (per ICO 14498) from the north & south boundaries and 1220' setback (per Commission policy)
from the east & west boundaries within the 1280 acre drilling unit consisting of Section 1 & 12 T153N R101W.

PERMIT STIPULATIONS: A CLOSED MUD SYSTEM IS REQUIRED ON MULTI-WELL PADS,
ALTHOUGH THE DISPOSAL OF DRILL CUTTINGS IS CONTINGENT UPON SITE SPECIFIC

inaccuracies are not considered when determining compliance with the spacing/drilling unit boundary setback requirement except in the
following scenarios: 1) When the angle between the well bore and the respective boundary is 10 degrees or less; or 2) If Industry standard
methods and equipment are not utilized. Consult the applicable field order for exceptions.

If measurement inaccuracies are required to be considered, a 2° MWD measurement inaccuracy will be applied to the horizontal portion of the well
bore. This measurement inaccuracy is applied to the well bore from KOP to TD.

REQUIRED ATTACHMENTS: Certified surveyor's plat, horizontal section plat, estimated geological tops, proposed mud/cementing plan,

directional plot/plan, $100 fee.
