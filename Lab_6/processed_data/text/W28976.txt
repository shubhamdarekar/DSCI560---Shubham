INTRODUCTION

The Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC Wade Federal 5300 21-30 12T [SW NW Section 30,
TI53N, R1OOW] is located approximately 5 miles south of Williston, North Dakota. The horizontal
well was spud on September 30, 2014 and represents a continuation of Oasis Petroleum’s
development of the Three Forks Formation within Baker Field. The Wade Federal 5300 21-30 12T
was planned to drill an approximately 9,350’ lateral along a proposed azimuth of 89.37°. The well
bore will be enhanced for production by multistage fracture stimulation.

OFFSET CONTROL INFORMATION

Offset well data used for depth correlation during curve operations are found ‘Structure’ section
appended to this report. Offset well control was essential in curve operations, to successfully land
within the Three Forks. Formation thicknesses expressed by gamma ray signatures in these wells

were compared to gamma data collected during drilling operations in order to successfully land the
curve.

GEOLOGIC EVALUATION
Methods:

Geologic supervision of the Wade Federal 5300 21-30 12T was provided by Sunburst
Consulting, Inc. with two well site geologists. A digital gas detector and chromatograph were
interfaced with a Pason electronic data recorder system. The unit of measure for gas on this well
was units (u), which was defined as 100 units equaling 1% methane equivalent in air. The EDR
provided drill rate, on-off bottom and pump strokes to the gas detection computer and received
total gas information from Sunburst for viewing around location. Lagged samples were caught
by the rig crew in 30’ intervals from 4,870’ MD to 6,020’ MD, 30’ intervals from 8,200’ MD to
10,840’ MD, 10’ intervals from 10,840’ MD to 11,080’ MD, and 30’ intervals from 11,080’ MD
to 20,430’ TD. Wet and dry cuttings were examined under a tri-ocular microscope and complete
lithologic descriptions and sampling intervals are provided in the lithology document within this
evaluation. The set of dry cuttings collected during the duration of the well were sent to the State
of North Dakota. Evidence of light hydrocarbons present in the drilling fluid was reported by the
gas chromatography equipment and documented on the mud log presented with this report.

Zones of Interest:

The Mission Canyon Formation (Mississippian; Madison Group) was drilled at 9,330’ TVD
(-7,306’) and is comprised largely of light gray lime mudstone followed by gray to tan earthy
textured argillaceous lime mudstone. Shows within the Mission Canyon ranged from 50 to 467
units against 10.0 ppg mud.

Figure 3 & 4: Wet cutting of the Lodgepole Formation (left) and False Bakken sub-interval (right) at 10X.

The top of the Lodgepole Formation was logged at 9,886’ TVD (-7,862’). In general the
Lodgepole can be described as a medium to dark gray brown argillaceous lime mudstone with a
crystalline texture and trace amounts of disseminated pyrite (Figure 3). The False Bakken
(Carrington Shale), drilled at 10,612’ TVD (-8,588’), is comprised of very dark brown to black,
slightly pyritic shale with an earthy texture, and was found to be soft to firm (Figure 4). Strong
hydrocarbon shows in the lower 100’ of the Lodgepole were as high as 2,600 total gas units;
suggest that some of the oil and gas from the Upper Bakken Shale may be exploiting fractures
thought to exist in the Lower Lodgepole.

The Bakken Formation (Devonian — Mississippian) has four formal members, an upper and
lower black, fissile, organic-rich pyritic shale, separated by an arenaceous limestone, siltstone
and silty sandstone middle member. These three members overlay a silty shale or siltstone of the
Pronghorn Member toward the basin depositional center. The Upper Bakken Shale was drilled at
10,621’ TVD (-8,597’) with sample returns typically described as black, carbonaceous,
petroliferous shale with trace amounts of disseminated pyrite (Figure 5). The Middle Bakken,
penetrated at 10,638’ TVD (-8,614’), consists of a varying thickness and sequence of interbedded
siltstone, limestone and silty sandstone. Trace spotty light brown oil staining was present along
with gas shows as high as 829 TGU. This light brown spotty oil staining was common.
Penetrated at 10,678’ TVD (-8,654’), the Lower Bakken Shale was described as a black to dark
brown carbonaceous shale with trace amounts of disseminated pyrite (Figure 6). Gas shows
encountered in the Lower Bakken read as high as 797u (C1-C4). The Pronghorn was penetrated
at 10,688’ TVD (-8,664’) and is commonly described as a dark to medium gray siltstone with
calcite cement.

Using the aforementioned information gathered during drilling, offset log information and the
structural data provided from Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC., well site geologists were
able to anticipate, and interpret the local apparent dip during the drilling of the Wade Federal
5300 21-30 12T well. A total depth of 20,430’ MD was reached on December 01, 2014 at 6:45
CDT. The target resultant was 100% within the Three Forks Formation. The resulting structure
of the Three Forks was a fall in TVD of 67.70’ over 9,495’ MD; resulting in an overall down dip

of 0.41° as portrayed on the Wade Federal 5300 21-30 12T dip profile (Figure 10).

The Three Forks Formation (Devonian; Kaskaskia Sequence.) represents a regressive sequence
deposited in a supratidal sabkha environment. The top of the Three Forks was drilled at 10,708’
TVD (-8,684’) and is comprised of a light to medium gray, cream to off white sucrosic dolomite
with trace to occasional amounts of disseminated pyrite and light green shale also with trace
amounts of disseminated pyrite (Figures 7 & 8). Shows within the Three Forks Formation ranged
from 250 to 491 units in a drilling mud of 9.6-9.9 ppg.

Figure 7 & 8: Wet cuttings of the Three Forks dolomite and shale (left and right) at 10X.

Geo-steering:

Kick-off point for the curve was established from the isopach of the “base last salt” marker to the
Three Forks “target” in the offset wells. The Chalmers 5301 44-24 2TR was used as the primary
offset through the vertical and curve sections. While drilling the curve, measured gamma ray
signatures were compared to those of the three offsets and aided in the landing of the curve. The
landing target was confirmed by the depth of the False Bakken, which was consistent with the
offset wells. The curve was successfully landed within the Three Forks Formation at a depth of
11,080’ MD (10,734? TVD) placing the well bore approximately 26’ below the top of the Three
Forks Formation. Directional tools were then pulled out of the hole and a string of 7” casing was
set (11,072? MD) and then cemented by Schlumberger.

Samples from the target zone varied in porosity, oil staining, color, cementation, and pyrite
content. Stratigraphic location in the target zone was based on these sample observations along
with gas shows, drill rates and gamma ray values. Severe doglegs were to be avoided so as to
obtain the desired vertical section and aid in a successful completion liner run at TD.

The Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC prospect geologist defined the an initial target
zone as an 9’ zone that began 18’ below the top of the Three Forks Formation and ended at
the claystone member 27’ below the Three Forks Formation. The target zone consisted of an
upper dolomite and shale interval reading 90-120 count gamma (A marker). The center of
the target interval was comprised of a warmer dolomite with greater amounts of shale
reading 100-140 count gamma (B marker). The base of the target zone was characterized by
a clean dolomite with trace amounts of shale with gamma readings of 35-90 (C marker). The
A-C gamma markers were used for determining depth within the target interval and plotted
on the Wade Federal 5300 21-30 12T dip profile (Figure 10).

Hydrocarbons:

Gas monitoring and fluid gains were monitored to evaluate the viability of this reservoir during
the drilling of the Wade Federal 5300 21-30 12T well. In the invert mud system, hydrostatic
conditions were maintained near balance. This allowed for gas and fluid gains from the well to
be monitored. Gas shows were encountered in vertical, curve and lateral drilling of the well.

Invert drilling fluid was used throughout the drilling of the vertical and curve weighing 9.8-11.0

ppg. The lateral was drilled with saline drilling fluid with a mud weight of 9.7-9.8 ppg.
Background gas observed during the drilling of the lateral ranged from 50 to 500 units. Gas
shows ranged up to 886 units and connection gases were observed up to 777 units. C1-C4 gas
components were observed throughout the course of the lateral. Oil shows were very light
throughout the lateral ranging from 0-3% in sample. When present it was a light brown spotty oil
stain that yielded a slow to moderate streaming to diffuse light green cut fluorescence.

SUMMARY

The Nabors B25 drilling rig successfully drilled a two-section horizontal well bore within the
Three Forks Formation at the Wade Federal 5300 21-30 12T. A net of 9,350’ was drilled within
the Three Forks. A mud program consisting of diesel invert (9.8 — 11.0 ppg), during the vertical
and curve build sections, and saline based mud (9.7 -9.8 ppg), during the lateral maintained
stable hole conditions and permitted adequate analysis of gas concentrations.

Projections of dip were successfully used to maintain the well bore in the Three Forks Formation
target for 80% of the lateral. Samples from the target consisted of a light to medium gray, cream
to off white dolomite with trace to occasional amounts of disseminated pyrite and light green
shale also with trace amounts of disseminated pyrite. Intercrystalline porosity was generally seen
throughout the entire lateral. Hydrocarbon shows in the target zone were high throughout the
lateral. Samples from the ideal zone contained a spotty light brown oil stain.

The Wade Federal 5300 21-30 12T will be fitted with a 4 %” production liner and swell packers
in preparation for a fracture stimulation that will determine the true commercial value of the
well. The well currently awaits fracture stimulation.

LITHOLOGY

Rig crews caught lagged samples in 30’ and 10’ intervals under the supervision of Sunburst geologists. A detailed
list of sampling intervals is included in the well data summary page. Sample or gamma ray marker tops have been
inserted in the sample descriptions below for reference. Samples were examined wet and dry under a trinocular
microscope. The drilling fluid was diesel-based invert from surface casing to intermediate casing, while salt water
drilling fluid was used throughout the lateral. Sample collection began at 4,870’ MD.

SWNW Section 30-153N-100W
McKenzie County
Well File # 28976

Dear Brandi:

Pursuant to Commission Order No. 23752, approval to drill the above captioned well is hereby given. The approval is
granted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than the 500" setback from
the north & south boundaries and 200" setback from the east & west boundaries within the 1280 acre spacing unit consisting
of Sections 29 & 30'T153N R100W. Tool error is not required pursuant to order.

PERMIT STIPULATIONS: Effective June 1, 2014, a covered leak-proof container (with placard) for filter sock
disposal must be maintained on the well site beginning when the well is spud, and must remain on-site during
clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations are conducted. Due to drainage adjacent to
the well site, a dike is required surrounding the entire location. OASIS PETRO NO AMER must contact NDIC
Field Inspector Richard Dunn at 701-770-3554 prior to location construction.

Drilling pit

NDAC 43-02-03-19.4 states that “a pit may be utilized to bury drill cuttings and solids generated during well drilling and
completion operations, providing the pit can be constructed, used and reclaimed in a manner that will prevent pollution of
the land surface and freshwaters. Reserve and circulation of mud system through earthen pits are prohibited. All pits shall be
inspected by an authorized representative of the director prior to lining and use. Drill cuttings and solids must be stabilized
in a manner approved by the director prior to placement in a cuttings pit.”

Form 1 Changes & Hard Lines

Any changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC. The
proposed directional plan is at a legal location. Based on the azimuth of the proposed lateral the maximum legal coordinate
from the well head is: 10043’E.

Location Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period)

Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the approved
drilling permit on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report. If circumstances requite operations to commence before the 3rd
business day following publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may be waived by the Director.
Application for a waiver must be by sworn affidavit providing the information necessary to evaluate the extenuating
circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f), and any other information that would allow the Director to
conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the drilling permit, the applicant should retain the permit.

Permit Fee & Notification

Payment was received in the amount of $100 via credit card .The permit fee has been received. It is requested that
notification be given immediately upon the spudding of the well. This information should be relayed to the Oil & Gas
Division, Bismarck, via telephone. The following information must be included: Well name, legal location, permit number,
drilling contractor, company representative, date and time of spudding. Office hours are 8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and 1:00

RE: Filter Socks and Other Filter Media
Leakproof Container Required
Oil and Gas Wells

Dear Operator,

North Dakota Administrative Code Section 43-02-03-19.2 states in part that all waste material associated with
exploration or production of oil and gas must be properly disposed of in an authorized facility in accord with all
applicable local, state, and federal laws and regulations.

Filtration systems are commonly used during oil and gas operations in North Dakota. The Commission is very
concerned about the proper disposal of used filters (including filter socks) used by the oil and gas industry.

Effective June 1, 2014, a container must be maintained on each well drilled in North Dakota beginning when the
well is spud and must remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations
are conducted. The on-site container must be used to store filters until they can be properly disposed of in an
authorized facility. Such containers must be:

e leakproof to prevent any fluids from escaping the container

e covered to prevent precipitation from entering the container

e placard to indicate only filters are to be placed in the container

If the operator will not utilize a filtration system, a waiver to the container requirement will be considered, but
only upon the operator submitting a Sundry Notice (Form 4) justifying their request.

As previously stated in our March 13, 2014 letter, North Dakota Administrative Code Section 33-20-02.1-01
states in part that every person who transports solid waste (which includes oil and gas exploration and production
wastes) is required to have a valid permit issued by the North Dakota Department of Health, Division of Waste
Management. Please contact the Division of Waste Management at (701) 328-5166 with any questions on the
solid waste program. Note oil and gas exploration and production wastes include produced water, drilling mud,
invert mud, tank bottom sediment, pipe scale, filters, and fly ash.

Thank you for your cooperation.

Sincerely,

Brace E. Fichs

Michael,

Just realized that since there is not cuttings pit, we need to know what facility you will be hauling the
cuttings to for all three wells.

Thanks and have a great Friday!

Michael,

It is my understanding that you just called looking to get the Wade Federal well pad issued ASAP,
however we have two issues with this well pad.

| talked to Brandi this morning about the 14T2 well. Right now you have the surface casing at 1974’,
and we need that to be modified so that it is at least 1980’.

For the 13B well, the bottom hole location violates the 200’ setback. According to the drilling plan, it
is located 10,142’ from the wellhead (the other two wells are 10,042’), which would therefore put it
at 101’ from the east line. | left Brandi a voicemail about this issue a few minutes ago.

The sooner we get these, the sooner we can get your permit.

Feel free to contact me with any questions regarding these issues.

Thanks,

Ashley N. Burk
