STRIPPER WELL DETERMINATION

Dear Ms. Patocka:

Continental Resources, Inc. (Continental) filed with the North Dakota Industrial Commission —
Oil and Gas Division (Commission) on July 3, 2017 an application for a Stripper Well
Determination for the above captioned well.

Information contained in the application indicates that the above mentioned well is a stripper
well pursuant to statute and rule, and Continental has elected to designate said well as a stripper
well. The well produced from a well depth greater than 10000 feet and was completed after June
30, 2013. During the qualifying period, January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2016, the well
produced at a maximum efficient rate or was not capable of exceeding the production threshold.
The average daily production from the well was 19.6 barrels of oil per day during this period.

It is therefore determined that the above captioned well qualifies as a “Stripper Well” pursuant to
Section 57-51.1-01 of the North Dakota Century Code. This determination is applicable only to
the Bakken Pool in and under said well.

The Commission shall have continuing jurisdiction, and shall have the authority to review the
matter, and to amend or rescind the determination if such action is supported by additional or
newly discovered information. If you have any questions, do not hesitate to contact me.

Sincerely,

David J. McCusker

WELL SYNOPSIS

Lateral Leg:

Penetration of the lateral section started on January 16", 2013 at 10:15 hrs with a depth

of 10910’ MD, drilling with a 6” PDC bit and 1.5° mud motor. The plan was to drill in the
Target zone and follow the 8’ zone of interest in the cooler gamma/Dolomite zone, two
feet above the Internal 1 Shale. The lateral section was drilled from 10910’ MD to 20055’
MD for a lateral length of about 9145’, with a bottom hole location: 236’ FSL & 1845’ FWL
— SESW Sec 7, T153N-R101W — completed on January 22", 2013 — 15:55 hrs. The
section was drilled entirely in the Three Forks Formation. The lateral section consisted of
one complete trip for an MWD tool Failure @ 14547’ MD.

Samples collected in the lateral section mostly consisted of light-medium tan/brown, off
white Dolomite, mostly concentrated in the target zone just above the Internal Shale. The
upper zone of the Three Forks consisted of waxy blue/green Shales and was fairly
abundant through the target zone as well. The tan/brown sections also displayed
disseminated pyrite and showed good to excellent porosity but displayed no oil & gas
shows. The Internal Shale displayed dark red/brown - oxidized Limestone with traces of
blue/green Shale. There was no evidence of any oil and gas shows throughout the lateral
section. All three zones: upper target zone w/ blue/green shale, middle target zone w/
tan/brown Dolomite and the Internal zone w/ red/brown Limestone. Gas averaged 50-90
units of gas and no oil accumulating in the possum belly — fluorescence was completely
absent in every sample taken regardless of drilling location. (For more detailed sample
descriptions — see Atlanta 2-6H Lateral Log)

Utilizing two hot gamma markers along with a significant cool spot, drilling in the lower
target zone resulted in excellent formation dip markers throughout the lateral section. The
target zone top illustrates the first significant hot spot ranging (90-120 API) and the cool
gamma marker in the target zone ranged (50-70 API). Below the lower target zone line —
into the Internal Shale represents the second hot spot ranging (100-160 API). After
seeing both hot spots it was decided to drill between them. This zone had the best drilling
and well control, limiting the amount of sliding footage. Above or below the target zone
resulted in minimal well control w/ poor-fair build rates. The formation was projected to
climb 20-30’ for an average dip; 90.15. The Atlanta 2-6H climbed 35’ dropping about 3-4’
throughout the lateral for an average dip of a 90.2.

WELL SYNOPSIS

Well Plan:

Build Section:

The Atlanta 2-6H was spud on January 7'", 2013 with a surface location of

495’ FNL and 545’ FWL, NWNW Section 6 - Township 153 North and Range 101 West in
Williams Co., North Dakota. This well was operated by Continental Resources
Incorporated with the objective target of the late Devonian Three Forks Formation.

The plan showed a build section with a kickoff point of 10011’ MD in the Mississippian
Lodgepole with a 10°/100’ build rate to the landing point of 10912’ MD; 10584’ TVD in the
good gamma zone within the Three Forks Formation. This zone started approximately 19’
below the Three Forks. The landing target was approximately 15’ into the Three Forks
Formation. The plan was to drill lateral for an estimated 10080’ to the hardline in the
SESW of section 7 - Township 153 North and Range 101 West following the estimated
dip of 90.1°. The projected well path is to the Southeast with a proposed azimuth of
172.44°.

The offsets provided were the Lippert 1-12H drilled in Section 1 — T153N — R101W
operated by Brigham Oil and Gas LP, Hansen 1-3 drilling in Section 3 —T153N — R101W
operated by Citation Oil & Gas Corp., and the Atlanta 1-6H drilled by Continental
Resources.

Gas logged in the vertical and lateral sections were monitored using Mud Logging
Systems — Mlogger & Mcontrol. (Primary Logger: ML-197 — Backup Logger ML-145)
M-Logger CC & TC filaments calibrated with 1% and 100% test gas — Chromatograph
calibrated with 1% test gas (gas—units).

The well was kicked off at 10000’ MD on January 12", 2013 at 15:00 hrs. The Build
assembly was picked up @ 9689’ MD — 1/11/13 and 311’ of vertical was drilled before we
reached kickoff with the curve assembly. There was one trip for a bit @ 10028’ MD and
the curve section of the well resumed 1/13/13 — 10:50. This assembly was able to
generate sufficient builds to land the build section within the target zone. The up hole
markers logged were the Base of the Last Salt (9019’ TVD), Mission Canyon (9239°
TVD), and the Lodgepole (9781’ TVD). The down hole markers below kick off point
consisted of the False Bakken (10488’ TVD), Upper Bakken Shale (10494 TVD), Middle
Bakken Member (10509’ TVD), Lower Bakken Shale (10541’ TVD), and the Three Forks
Dolomite (10576’ TVD). These markers on average came in 5-6’ low versus the
prognosis and 1-2’ lower than the Atlanta 1-6H. With the markers coming in lower than
anticipated our actual landing point moved 5’ lower, which was expected since the
Lodgepole and Three Forks came in lower. The Lower Bakken Shale had a thickness of
11’ of actual black-brown shale, but consisted of a sticky intermediate layer below the
shale that was 24’ thick — our landing was targeted 15’ below this intermediate layer. The
landing for 7” intermediate casing was completed January 14", 2013 at 10:32 hrs. 22’
into the Three Forks Dolomite with a landing at 10598’ TVD. Casing point 10910’ MD;
10598’ TVD and casing location of NWNW Sec 6 — 1078’ FNL & 609’ FWL (see Atlanta
2-6H build and TVD log for more information)

Gas observed in the build section which showed gas averaging 40-150 units through the
Lodgepole formation with no background sample shows and oil shows. Both Upper and
Lower Bakken Shales showed little amounts of gas resulting in 350-650 units. The Middle
Bakken Member ranged from 220-520 units, averaging 310 units. The Three Forks
ranged from 200-450 units, averaging 240 units. Circulating trip gas through casing
resulted in 2200-3900 units.

CONTINENTAL RESOURCES, INC. June 12, 2012
Report of Geotechnical Engineering Analysis ATS No. 12-12165
Atlanta Drill Pad Near Williston, ND

Cut Sections:

We recommend that any structure, drill rig, or other more permanent elements which are
intolerant to differential movement be placed on the cut areas of the site.

Based on our drill program, we know that variable depths of sand mixtures overlie fat clay glacial
till in the cut areas of the site. We recommend the fill pad finished elevation be established at the
fat clay till contact or the Sands be totally removed to the glacial till contact and then replaced with
compacted clays. {tis desired to not have layers of sand over Clays as instability can result with
moisture accumulation below sands and atop clays.

Fill Sections:

We recommend that no structure, drill rig, or other more permanent elements which are intolerant
to differential Movement be placed over fil| areas. If itis desired or necessary to occupy fill areas,
we recommend placement of such elements not be conducted until the fill sections have been
allowed to consolidate for a minimum of one (1) year. We recommend the fill sections be
monitored for vertical and horizontal movement Upon completion in order to determine the Stability
of the sections.

We recommend the Swales (valleys) which will be filled have underdrains installed prior to placing
fill, We recommend pairs (set of 2 pipes) of 6” flexible PVC drain tile materials be installed along
the toes of the existing swales prior to placing fill, The underdrain pipes should be sloped to
daylight and must be kept unobstructed.

Fill placed on the existing toes of slopes must be keyed ina minimum depth of five (5) feet prior to
Placing fill Fil! must also be horizontally benched into existing slopes as fill is placed, We

Drainage Considerations:

We recommend an intercepting drainage trench be ©xcavated atop the cut to divert surface runoff
away from the site. We also recommend the final drill pad be Sloped to drain at a minimum rate
of 5%.

We recommend the drill pad finished surface consist of compacted clays (either exposed native
soils or placed Clay soils) to minimize subsurface infiltration. Service gravel with separation
fabric should be used in traffic areas to allow for access over Clay surfaces.

Earthwork Considerations:

All fill soils must be moisture conditioned to +/-3% of optimum moisture content and be compacted
to a minimum of 95% of ASTM D 698 Standard proctor value.

Loose lifts of fill must not exceed 8” and may be increased to 12” if Proper compaction equipment
is used and density is verified, Cut/fill earthwork operations in freezing weather must be
monitored for frost intrusion and frost lensing. Cut/fill earthwork in winter months is not
recommended for this site due to the depths of fitf planned.

SITE CONDITIONS
Surface:

The Atlanta Drill Pad site is located approximately 5 miles southwest of Williston, North Dakota.
The site lies on the breaks of the Missouri River. The surface at the pad site consists of ridge and
swale topography with well defined drainage swales present. The surface is primarily grass and
weed covered with overall drainage trending to the south.

Subsurface:

Detailed soil profiles are presented in the boring logs in the Appendix. Based on our
analysis, we have determined the soil profile at the proposed Atlanta Drill Pad site consists of
variable depths of sand and clay glacial deposits overlying fat clay glacial till and Pierre
Shale. The sand and clay glacial deposits have variable amounts of clay, sand, gravel and
traces of coal. The sands are of low plasticity and the fat clay glacial till is highly plastic and
expansive.

Groundwater Conditions:

Groundwater was encountered at our Boring 1 (57’ below existing site grades) location, and at
approximately 15 to 18 feet below existing site grades at our boring 8, 9, and 10 locations (lower area
of site). Fluctuations in the groundwater table may occur for various reasons, i.e., variations in
precipitation, evaporation, surface runoff, groundwater withdrawal and recharge. A more accurate
evaluation of the water table would require installing and monitoring piezometers over an extended
time period,

Laboratory Analyses:

In-situ moisture contents and dry densities of representative samples from the borings are presented
on the boring logs in the Appendix.

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
GENERAL

Our recommendations are based on the assumption that the soil conditions are similar to
those disclosed by the provided samples. If variations are noted during construction or if
changes are made in the site plan, structural loading, or foundation type, we should be
notified so we can supplement our recommendations, as applicable. This report does not
encompass the effects, if any, of underlying geologic hazards or regional groundwater
withdrawal and expresses no opinion regarding their effects on surface movement.

Global Slope Stability:

The Owner elected not to conduct a Slope stability analysis at this site. Thus, our
recommendations are given with no acceptance or assumption of the global stability of the
slopes at this site. Global stability issues may be present and may create fand shifting or
Sliding in the future.

INTRODUCTION

This report presents the results of our geotechnical engineering analysis of the soils at the proposed
Atlanta Drill Pad site located approximately 5 miles southwest of Williston, North Dakota. This analysis
was authorized by Jade Hedge of Brosz Engineering on behalf of Continental Resources.

Our services included laboratory testing of provided samples, performing engineering analysis, providing
recommendations for use in drill pad design and construction. Results of the laboratory tests are
presented in the report.

Our professional services were performed using the degree of care and skill ordinarily exercised, under
similar circumstances, by geotechnical engineers practicing in this or similar localities. No other
warranty, express or implied, is made. This report is not a bidding document. Any contractor reviewing
this report must draw his own conclusions regarding site conditions and specific construction techniques
to be used on this project.

PROJECT INFORMATION

Project information supplied by Brosz Engineering indicates Continental Resources intends to
construct a drill pad near Williston, North Dakota. [tis our understanding the site will be leveled by
massive cut/fill construction. Based on our review of the provided site plans, some fill sections
will be upwards of 50 feet in depth. Based on the request for proposai from Brosz Engineering,
we are to provide a geotechnical evaluation of the site, provide recommendations for benching
and side slopes, and provide Slope construction guidelines.

We previously submitted (March, 2012) a proposal for the work at this site which included a slope
Stability analysis. We understand the Owner elected not to conduct the slope stability analysis.

SUBSURFACE EXPLORATION & TESTING PROGRAMS

We conducted ten (10) explorations to depths of 21 to 61 feet below existing site grades at the Atlanta
Drill pad site. The explorations were at the approximate location shown on the attached site plan,

The Unified Soil Classification System was used to classify the soils encountered. Laboratory analyses

were performed on representative soil samples to aid in material classification and to estimate pertinent
engineering properties of the on-site soils. Testing was performed in accordance with applicabie ASTM
specifications.

The scope of our services did not include any environmental assessment or investigation for the
presence or absence of hazardous or toxic materials in the soil, surface water, groundwater or air, on
or below this site. All conditions noted or observed are Strictly for the information of our client, If
environmental information is required, we recommend an environmental assessment be conducted
which addresses environmental concerns.

4) After subgrade preparation and compaction, we recommend gravel base course or
desired surfacing be placed. We recommend stabilization/separation fabric such as
Mirafi HP370 be placed between the soil subgrade and surfacing material.
Oversized rock may be required high traffic or soft soil areas.

DRILL PAD FILL SECTIONS:

We recommend that no structure, drill rig, or other more permanent elements which are
intolerant to differential movement be placed over fill areas.

If it is desired or necessary to occupy fill areas, we recommend placement of such elements
not be conducted until the fill sections have been allowed to consolidate for a minimum of one
(1) year. We recommend the fill sections be monitored for vertical and horizontal movement
upon completion in order to determine the stability of the sections.

We recommend the final slopes be no steeper than 3:1 (horizontal to vertical).
Underdrains:

We recommend the swales (valleys) which will be filled have underdrains installed prior to
placing fill. We recommend pairs (set of 2 pipes) be installed along the toes of the existing
swales prior to placing fill. We recommend the underdrains consist of 6" diameter fabric
wrapped flexible perforated drain pipe. We recommend the drain pipe be bedded with a
minimum of 42 inches of 1” clean rock bedding for the entire pipe length at the specified
locations. The underdrain pipes should be sloped to daylight and must be kept unobstructed.

Keyways:

At the toes of the existing slopes, we recommend the native soils have a keyway cut to aid in
supporting slope fill retention. We recommend the slope keyway consist of a five (5) foot
minimum vertical cut in the native approved soils aiong the east side toe. Keyway areas
over daylight pipe areas may be modified depending on depth. We recommend the keyway
be a minimum of 10 feet in width. Additional underdrains may be required for the system if
water is encountered within keyways.

Fill Construction:

We understand the fill for the pad will come from on-site as the grading is conducted. With
the aforementioned grading pian in mind and our analysis of the soils present, we offer the
following grading recommendations:

1) We recommend the fill areas be stripped to receive new fill. Stripping should clear all
vegetation, topsoil and debris. The depth of such materials and horizonta! extent of
the fill/cut slopes will vary along the proposed toe slopes.

2) We recommend a minimum of 8 inches of the soils at the base of fill sections be
removed (includes topsoil),

Atlanta Drill Pad Near Williston, ND

Geotechnical Summary:

The Atlanta Drill Pad will be constructed on a site with ridge and swale topography on the
breaks of the Missouri River near Williston. We understand the Atianta Drill pad will be
created with massive cut and fill earthwork techniques. Cut depths on the order of 20 to 25
feet and fili depths up to 50 feet are planned for the construction of the drill pad.

We recommend an intercepting drainage trench be excavated atop the cut to divert surface
runoff away from the site. We also recommend the final drill pad be sloped to drain at a
minimum rate of 5%.

We recommend the drill pad finished surface consist of compacted clays (either exposed
native soils or placed clay soils) to minimize subsurface infiltration. Service gravel with
separation fabric should be used in traffic areas to allow for access over clay surfaces.

We are providing drill pad construction earthwork recommendations given the soil profile and
knowing the earthwork required to create the drill pad.

DRILL PAD CUT SECTIONS:

We recommend that any structure, drill rig, or other more permanent elements which are
intolerant to differential movement be placed on the cut areas of the site.

Based on our drill program, we know that variable depths of sand mixtures overlie fat clay
glacial till in the cut areas of the site. We recommend the fill pad finished elevation be
established at the fat clay till contact or the sands be totally removed to the glacial till contact
and then replaced with compacted clays. It is desired to not have layers of sand over clays
as instability can result with moisture accumulation below sands and atop clays.

For grading cut slope design purposes and due to the presence of sandy soils, we
recommend cut slopes be designed to slope at a rate of no steeper than 3:1 (horizontal to
vertical). Said slopes will allow for maintenance and repair as necessary and will minimize
erosion after vegetation is established, We offer the following grading guidelines for
construction of surfacing or elements (excluding permanent structures) over cut sections:

1) We recommend a minimum of 8 inches of the on-site surficial soils and topsoil be
removed, as applicable.

2) We recommend the soils exposed in the cut area be scarified a minimum of 8 inches,
and be moisture conditioned to +/-3% of optinum moisture content.

3) We recommend the soils be compacted to a minimum of 95% of ASTM 698 standard
proctor value. Compaction equipment must be sufficient to gain the desired results
and will depend on the soils placed. The geotechnical engineer should observe,
Classify, and test the soils during the fill placement to assure proper techniques are
employed.

3. Respective subgrade preparation area to be accomplished in a manner which will
resuit in uniform water contents and densities after compaction.

4. Soft, wet or debris laden soil lenses may require additional removal and
replacement with oversized rock to stabilize.

MATERIALS

1.

Granular engineered fill for structures should consist of on-site or imported
sand or gravel. Structure placement recommendations is beyond the scope of
this report.

Frozen soils should not be used as fill or backfill.

Gravel surfacing materiais should conform to the following:

fe) Gradation (ASTM C136):

Sieve Size Percent Finer By Weight
3” 100
No. 4 Sieve 40-100
No. 200 Sieve 15 (max)
Liquid Limit 25 (max)
fe) Maximum expansive potential(%) *0.2

*Measured on a sample compacted to approximately 95 percent of the ASTM D698
maximum dry density at about 3 percent below optimum water content, The sample is
confined under a 100 psf surcharge and submerged.

4.

Acceptance of use of on-site materials shall be at the direction of the
geotechnical engineer. The on-site soils shall be placed in an engineered
manner. Moisture and density conditioning of the soil is critical.

PLACEMENT AND COMPACTION

1.

Place and compact fill in horizontal lifts using equipment and procedures that
will produce recommended water contents and densities throughout the lift.

No fill should be placed over frozen ground.

Materials should be compacted to the following:

Soil Minimum Percent
Placement Compaction (ASTM D698)
Miscellaneous fill ------------~-~------------------- 95

On -site and imported soils should be compacted at or near
optimum moisture conditions.

Atlanta Drill Pad Near Williston, ND

3) We recommend the soils present at the bottom of the aforementioned stripping depth
be proofroiled in the presence of the geotechnical engineer. Soft or debris laden soil
areas May require removal or stabilization with oversized rock prior to placing fill.

4) tis critical that newly placed embankment fill be benched into the existing side slopes
as the fill is raised. We recommend a minimum bench width of eight (8) feet or one
(1) scraper width per every two (2) feet of fill placed.

5) The soils placed must be placed in an engineered manner. The soils should be
moisture conditioned to within 3% of optimum moisture content and be compacted to
a minimum of 95% of ASTM D 698 standard proctor value. Compaction equipment
must be sufficient to gain the desired results and will depend on the soils placed,
The geotechnical engineer should observe, classify, and test the soits during the fill
placement to assure proper techniques are employed.

6) Loose lifts of fill must not exceed 8” and may be increased to 12” if proper compaction
equipment is used and density is verified. Cut/fill earthwork operations in freezing
weather must be monitored for frost intrusion and frost lensing. Cut/fill earthwork in
winter months is not recommended for this site due to the depths of fill planned.

T) We recommend that all finished fill slopes for the roadways be covered with topsoil
and/or be hydro-seeded as soon as possible after the slopes have been finished to
avoid excessive moisture intrusion and erosion. Seeding and erosion control
measures should then follow as dictated by progress.

8) Erosion control measures must be implemented during and after construction to avoid
loss of soil structure and sedimentation due to surface water infiltration and erosion.
Erosion control techniques and materials should be upgraded or repaired as
necessary during the course of construction. We recommend final slopes be no
steeper than 3:1 (horizontal to vertical) to reduce erosion and facilitate mowing, etc.
Steeper slopes can be used, however, maintenance during and after construction
must be provided.

9) We estimate a shrinkage of soil from cut to fill of 25%.

Buried Debris, Large Cobbles, Boulders & Lignite Coal Lenses:

Buried debris may be present at any location at this site. Traces of lignite coal was
encountered during our drilling and sampling program at this site. Cobbles were also
encountered in the mixed glacial deposit areas.

We recommend buried debris pockets and lignite coal lenses, if exposed, be observed by the
geotechnical engineer to determine the affects of the soils with respect to the drill pad,
Removal and replacement of said materials may be required.

Large cobbles or boulders encountered may be placed at the bottom of fill areas as long as
large particles are not allowed to “nest”. Such particles should be isolated and surrounded
by compacted fill.

CONTINENTAL RESOURCES, INC. June 12, 2042
Report of Geotechnical Engineering Analysis ATS No. 12-12165
Atlanta Drill Pad Near Williston, ND

Frost Depth Considerations
A minimum frost depth of 5 feet (60 inches) should be used for pertinent element design.
DRAINAGE AND MOISTURE PROTECTION

It is extremely important that the site soils not be allowed to become saturated during or after
construction. Sump pumps should be present during construction to facilitate water removal
after inclement weather,

Surface drainage is critical to assure long tank pad life. Grades should be such that
drainage is away from all structures. Utility line excavations should be properly backfilled to
avoid possible sources for subsurface Saturation. The finished exterior grades of the pad
must be sloped a minimum of 5% to promote positive drainage. Respective structure or well
pads should be elevated relative to the surrounding finished grades to aid in promoting
positive drainage.

We recommend the surface across the pad consist of native or placed compacted clay. We
recommend any clay cap material be moisture conditioned to +/-3% of optimum moisture
content and be compacted to a minimum of 95% of ASTM D 698 standard proctor value.

OSHA SLOPE STABILITY
GENERAL

The owner and contractor should make themselves aware of and become familiar with
applicable tocal, state, and federal safety regulations, including the current OSHA Excavation
and Trench Safety Standards. Construction site safety generally is the sole responsibility of
the Contractor, who shall also be solely responsible for the means, methods, and sequencing
of construction operations. We are providing this information Solely as a service to our
client. Under no circumstances should the information provided below be interpreted to
mean that American Technical Services, Inc., is assuming responsibility for construction site
safety or the Contractor's activities; such responsibility is not being implied and should not be
inferred,

EXCAVATIONS AND SLOPES

The Contractor should be aware that slope height, slope inclination, or excavation depths
(including utility trench excavations) should in no case exceed those specified in local, state,
or federal safety regulations, e.g., OSHA Health and Safety Standards for Excavations, 29
CFR Part 1926, or successor regulations, such regulations are strictly enforced and, if they
are not followed, the Owner, Contractor, and/or earthwork and utility subcontractors could be
liable for substantial penalties.

For this site, the overburden soil encountered in our exploratory investigation is primarily a
sand. This is considered to be a type B soil when applying the OSHA regulations. OSHA
recommends a maximum slope inclination of 1:1 - (horizontal/vertical) for type B soils. Asa
safety measure, it is recommended that all vehicles and soil piles be kept a minimum lateral
distance from the crest of the slope equal to no less than the slope height. Also, the
exposed slope face should be protected against the elements.

CONTINENTAL RESOURCES, INC. June 12, 2012
Report of Geotechnical Engineering Analysis ATS No, 12-12165
Atlanta Drill Pad Near Williston, ND

We recommend that you retain us to monitor the soils exposed in all excavations and provide
engineering services for such slopes. This will provide an opportunity to monitor the soil
types encountered and to modify the excavation slope as necessary. It also offers an
opportunity to verify the soil type and bearing capacity of the exposed soils.

EARTHWORK
GENERAL

1. The conclusions in this report are contingent upon compiiance with

recommendations in this section.

2. Due to the possible presence of buried debris, lignite coal, and groundwater
impacted soils, we recommend the geotechnical engineer or his representative
observe the soils exposed at bottom of slope keyway elevations and along
underdrain areas prior to placing fill. Additional overexcavation and
replacement may be required.

SITE CLEARING

Strip and remove existing debris, soft or loose soil and any other deleterious materials from
the building and parking areas and at least 5 feet beyond. All exposed surfaces should be
free of mounds and depressions which could prevent uniform compaction,

EXCAVATION

1, Standard excavation equipment should be sufficient for excavations at this site.
Buried debris or large cobble to boulder sized materials may be encountered which
are difficult to handle.

2. On-site soils may pump if allowed to become saturated. Scarification and drying,
replacement with granular materials, use of special equipment or stabilization may
be required to minimize subgrade pumping.

CONSTRUCTION OVER CUT OR FILL AREAS
1, Drain, prepare and construct cut or fill areas as presented in the respective sections
of this report. Fill section consolidation period with monitoring is recommended
prior to construction of elements.
2. Drainage of cut and fill slope surfaces in critical to prevent erosion and slope

movement. Drill pad surface cross-slopes must be maintained at a minimum of
9% to promote surface drainage.

i

INTRODUCTION

Our presence on the above referenced project was requested by Continental Resources
of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.

We were to observe and test the overexcavation and fill placement over the spillage liner
placed below the Atlanta Drill Pad being constructed in Williston, North Dakota.

EXCAVATION OBSERVATIONS

Pad Spillage Liner Excavation & Subgrade Preparation:

We observed the overexcavation of the spillage liner on August 12,2012. We observed
that the bottom of the overexcavation was taken to 5 feet below finished grades in the
spillage liner site. The bottem of the overexcavation was recompacted and smoothed
prior to synthetic liner installation.

The synthetic liner material was delivered in rolls and placed over the prepared subgrade
soils. We observed that the liner laos were welded as the liner materials were pulled into
place,

Liner Area Backfill:

On August 14, 2072, we observed on-site soil placement over the synthetic liner. A
cushion layer was compacted in place then material was placed via scrapers. Water
was added and dozers mixed the soils prior to compaction in lifts. Alll compaction tesis
taken indicate the backfill material was placed in an engineered manner.

DETAILS OF WORK

Continental Resources, Inc. (CRI) requests permission for suspension of drilling for up to 90 days for the referenced
well under NDAC 43-02-03-55, CRI intends to drill the surface hole with freshwater based drilling mud and set surface
casing with a small drilling rig and move off within 3 to 5 days. The casing will be set at a depth pre-approved by the
NDIC per the Application for Permit to Drill NDAC 43-02-03-21. No saltwater will be used in the drilling and cementing
operations of the surface casing. Once the surface casing is cemented, a plug or mechanical seal will be placed at
the top of the casing to prevent any foreign matter from getting into the well. A rig capable of drilling to TD will move
onto the location within the 90 days previously outlined to complete the drilling and casing plan as per the APD. The
undersigned states that this request for suspension of drilling operations in accordance with the Subsection 4 of
Section 43-02-03-55 of the NDAC, is being requested to take advantage of the cost savings and time savings of using
an initial rig that is smaller than the rig necessary to drill a well to total depth but is not intended to alter or extend
the terms and conditions of, or suspend any obligation under, any oil and gas lease with acreage In or under the
spacing or drilling unit for the above-referenced well. CRI understands NDAC 43-02-03-31 requirements regarding
confidentiality pertaining to this permit. The drilling pit will be fenced immediately after construction if the well pad is
located in a pasture (NDAC 43-02-03-19 & 19.1). CRI will plug and abandon the well and reclaim the well site if the
well is not drilled by the larger rotary rig within 90 days after spudding the well with the smaller drilling rig.

the 500’ setback from the north or west boundaries and 200' setback from the east or south boundaries within
the 2560 acre spacing unit consisting of Sections 5, 6, 7, & 8 T153N R101W.

PERMIT STIPULATIONS: A sufficient number of horizontal wells shall be drilled and completed in
the 2560-acre spacing unit described as Sections 5, 6, 7, and 8, Township 153 North, Range 101 West,
McKenzie and Williams Counties, North Dakota, which reasonably develop all portions of the 2560-acre
spacing unit within two years after the first horizontal well is completed. If this condition is not met, the
Commission shall schedule the matter for a consideration to reduce the size of the spacing unit THIS
WELL IS LOCATED IN A SURFACE WATER PROTECTION AREA: ONSITE INSPECTION
REQUIRED (CONTACT NDIC FIELD INSPECTOR FOR SITE SPECIFIC STIPULATIONS). TO
INCLUDE BUT NOT LIMITED TO: CLOSED MUD SYSTEM, NO DRILLING PIT, AND
IMPERMEABLE LINER IS REQUIRED ON THE ENTIRE LOCATION AND A STRING OF

Drilling pit

NDAC 43-02-03-19.4 states that “a pit may be utilized to bury drill cuttings and solids generated during well drilling and
completion operations, providing the pit can be constructed, used and reclaimed in a manner that will prevent pollution of
the land surface and freshwaters. Reserve and circulation of mud system through earthen pits are prohibited. All pits shall be
inspected by an authorized representative of the director prior to lining and use. Drill cuttings and solids must be stabilized
in a manner approved by the director prior to placement in a cuttings pit.”

Continental Resources, Inc. (CRI) respectfully submits the following information concerning the drilling
of the Atlanta 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 -- 6H, N/2 NW/4 Sec. 6, T153N, R101 W,
Williams County, North Dakota.

The Atlanta well(s) are located in a Well Head Protection Area. CRI would like to propose the
following safeguards and precautions to be taken to prevent any contamination to freshwater sources
during the drilling and completion of the well.

1)

2)
3)

4)
5)

6)

7)
8)

9)

During construction of the location, the entire location will be constructed per NDIC permit
stipulations, and to ensure any spills or runoff which occur on location do not penetrate the fresh
ground water and are contained on surface of the location.

Drainage will be re-routed to avoid the location and fiber rolls will be employed around the site
to reduce sediment contamination to freshwater runoff due to weather events.

The earthen berm constructed to keep any freshwater runoff off the location will also eliminate
any spills from leaving the location

No reserve pit or dry cuttings pit will be utilized on location.

The conductor will be drilled to a depth of 80’ and 20” pipe will be run to depth and cemented to
surface,

During drilling operations, a freshwater protection string of 13-3/8” 48# H40 casing will be set to
a depth of 500’ and cemented to surface to protect the shallow freshwater zones. Standard 9-
5/8” 36# J-55 surface casing will be set 100° into the Pierre Shale to a depth of 1970° and
cemented to surface.

A frac string will be used to protect the intermediate casing during hydraulic fracturing of the
well.

CRI is submitting a comprehensive; site specific Spill Contingency Plan to prepare for any event
which may occur during drilling and completion operations.

CRI believes a Flood Prevention plan is not necessary for this site due to the Army Corps of
Engineers documentation that the high water level for Lake Sakakawea will not affect any
elevation 1855’ above sea level or higher. The finished rig grade elevation for Atlanta location
is 1959.6’ above sea level.

10) The Atlanta wells will be drilled continuously. They will be batch drilled. The order of drilling

for all wells on the pad will be:

4 12.5.4;

b. 11, 12, 13, 14,
ce: 9:10,

d. 5,6, 7, 8.

CRI believes adequate planning and precautions are being taken to prevent any contamination to ground
water, shallow aquifers, and fresh water reservoirs.

To: Todd Holweger, NDIC
From: Shawn Svob
Date: 4/5/2012

Re: Continental Resources standard CCL, CBL, 4-1/2” liner running and testing procedures

Continental Resources’ standard practice for running the cement bond log and casing
caliper log is to run both logs immediately after coming out of the hole after TD, prior to running
the 4-1/2” liner, to the deepest depth obtainable; however, if there are well control concerns that
require us to run the liner sooner, only the CBL will be run and the CCL will be run after setting
the liner.

Based on the CCL results, we determine the actual API minimum burst allowance for the 7”
casing. If the downgraded API burst pressure is below our minimum required frac pressures, we
will run a 4-1/2” frac string; if severe wear or holes are found in the casing, we will run a 5”
cemented, to surface, tie back string.

The CBL log is run in order to determine the top of cement, as required by the NDIC.
Our current 4-1/2” liner program for a 1280 unit is 30, evenly spaced, stages with 29 swellable
packers. The liner shoe is set approximately 180 feet off bottom. The shoe stage below the last
packer has 2 joints, a double valved float, one joint, and a ported guide shoe — appx 130 ft. The
liner is run using a running tool on the end of 4” DP. The 7” packer/hanger is set about 40 ft
above KOP between two casing collars but conditions occasionally occur that require setting
higher, either through unexpected failure or in order to isolate casing wear close to KOP.
Recently we have tried 40 stage liners and the trend to explore the optimum stage count will
continue.. Once the liner is at depth, a ball is dropped through the DP, the ball is pressured up
against the setting tool to approximately 2500 psi, and the 7” packer/hanger is set.

A push pull test is done to confirm the hanger has set. Then, a 4500 psi pressure test is
completed on the back side of the 4” DP to confirm the packer has set. The setting tool is then
backed off and the 4” DP/running tool is laid down.

Immediately after the rotary rig has been moved off the well location, the 7” csg and liner
packer/ hanger are tested to the frac pressure. The testers will rig up and test the tubing head to
5000 psi. Next a test plug will be run and set, using wire line, in the top of the 7” packer/hanger.
Testers will pressure up to our frac pressure, typically 8500 psi, to confirm the 7” is ready for
completion.

PURPOSE OF PROGRAM

It is Continental Resources Inc. practice, to provide for the safety of its employees and contractor's
employees at the job site, and to provide for the protection of the environment in accordance with
applicable laws and regulations.

The primary purpose of this contingency pian is to guide location personnel in the responses
expected of them in the event that hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is liberated during the drilling program.

Hydrogen Sulfide is extremely hazardous to normal oil field operations due to its capability (1) of
destroying life at very low concentrations and (2) of causing instantaneous failure of high strength
metals. Drilling and producing operations of hydrocarbons containing toxic gases can, however, be
performed safety and without incident when the necessary precautions are taken and the outlined
safety procedures are followed. It is imperative that sulfide resistant materials be used, that the
proper safety equipment be used, that this equipment be properly maintained, and that all safety
regulations be complied with.

The procedures outlined are for your safety and the safety of all others: therefore, it is mandatory
that each individual give his one hundred percent cooperation.

TEMPORARY SERVICE PERSONNEL
All service personnel such as cementing crews, logging crews, specialists, mechanics, and welders
will furnish their own safety equipment as required, to comply with OSHA and the DRILLING
FOREMAN for CONTINENTAL RESOURCES INC.
VISITORS

1. VISITORS will be restricted when Hydrogen Sulfide might be unless accompanied by the
DRILLING FOREMAN for CONTINENTAL RESOURCES INC.

2. VISITORS and non-essential personnel will be prohibited from remaining in or entering
contaminated areas where Hydrogen Sulfide concentration in the atmosphere exceeds 10 ppm.

NOTE: WHEN HYDROGEN SULFIDE MIGHT BE ENCOUNTERED NO PERSONNEL ON
LOCATION WILL BE PERMITTED TO SLEEP IN VEHICLES.

RESPONSIBILITIES AND DUTIES

ALL PERSONNEL

1. It is the responsibility of all personnel on location to farniliarize themselves with the
safety procedures.

2. All personnel will attend to their personal safety first.

3. Help anyone who may be injured or overcome by toxic gases. The Drilling Foreman
will assign someone to administer first aid to unconscious person (s).

4. Report to the designated "SAFE BRIEFING AREA" and follow the
instructions of the Drilling Foreman.

specified herein are complied with or cannot be followed.

3. The Drilling Foreman will notify the Safety Advisor at least two weeks before the
safety equipment specified herein is needed.

4. The Drilling Foreman will keep the number of personnel on location to a minimum
during hazardous operations.

5. The Drilling Foreman is responsible for designating the "SAFE BRIEFING AREA".
This "SAFE BRIEFING AREA" will change depending upon wind direction and must be
redesignated as soon as a wind change occurs.

6. lf an unexpected emergency occurs or the H2S alarm sounds, the Drilling Foreman
will assess the situation and will advise all personne! what condition exists.

7. When it is necessary to secure the location, the access road to location will be
blocked; personnel from the rig crew will be used to guard same.

12. When available 24-hour radio or telephone communication will be provided at the rig.
Emergency telephone numbers will be prominently posted: SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT,
AMBULANCE, HOSPITALS, DOCTORS, AND OPERATORS' SUPERVISORY PERSONNEL.

13. Filter-type gas masks are not suitable for protection from Hydrogen Sulfide on drilling rigs.
Pressure demand, SCBA'S will be provided for use in any Hydrogen Sulfide concentration. They
are not physically exhausting to use, are rugged and dependable, and require little maintenance.

14. SCBA'S will be stored on racks and protected from the weather. Rig crew equipment will be
located at readily accessible location on the rig floor. For hygienic reasons, SCBA'S are to be
cleaned and sterilized at regular intervals. A six outlet air supply manifold will be installed on the rig
floor for continuous use by crews and supervisory personnel working in a "Mask On" situation.

The multi-bottle supply cylinders are to be located approximately 200 feet from the well. A minimum
of 3,600 cu. ft. compressed breathing air will be on location at ail times.

15. An alarm system which can be heard during operations and which can be activated from
several points if gas is detected will be installed. When the alarm is sounded, personnel must
assemble at the BRIEFING AREA designated SAFE. However, your company may have steps
different from these, so pay heed to the requirements on your rig.

16. There will be No Smoking on rig floor or near wellhead. Designated Smoking Areas will be
provided by your Supervisor.

17. Safety meetings and training sessions will be held at frequent intervals by the Safety
Advisor, the Drilling Supervisor, or the Rig Supervisor. All persons required to work on location will
be thoroughly familiar with the use, care and servicing of the following: Personal protective
equipment such as respirators, and gas detection equipment.

18. All electric lighting, wiring and electrical devices within 100 feet of the well will be put in
vapor-proof condition to minimize the possibility of explosion.

19. Blowout preventers should meet or exceed the recommendations for hydrogen sulfide
service (API RP 53). Choke manifolds will be of similar materiais.

20. Inspection of installation, operation, and testing of blowout preventers, choke manifolds,
etc., dressed for Hydrogen Sulfide services, will be conducted reguiarly.

21. Every person involved in the operation will be informed of the characteristics of Hydrogen
Sulfide and its dangers, safe procedures to use when it is encountered, and recommended first aid
procedures. This will be done through frequent safety talks and training sessions.

THE DRILL SITE

The location as shown in Figure 2 is planned in order to obtain the maximum safety benefits
consistent with the rig configuration, well depth, and prevailing winds.

1. Through the use of several maps, the area within a One mile radius of the location has
been surveyed and contacts with ail permanent residents have been made. Except in a dead calm
and a tremendous release of high concentration gases, the probability of lethal dosages beyond
one mile is extremely unlikely. Note on the rig layout plat, Figure 2, the direction of prevailing winds.

2. The location of houses, schoois, roads, and anything where people may be present and
who might need to be warned or evacuated in a crisis have been surveyed. This information with
names and telephone numbers are keyed and listed on page 11 and Figure 3 for use if evacuation
might be necessary should an emergency develop.

3. The drilling rig, see Figure 2, should be situated at such a location that prevailing winds
blow across the rig toward the flare pit.

4. Two (2) SAFETY BRIEFING AREAS will be established not less than 200 feet from the
wellhead and in locations so that at least one SAFE BRIEFING AREA will be up-wind of the weil at
all times.

5. Protective equipment will be stored in strategic locations around the wellsite and each of
the SAFE BRIEFING AREAS. Such equipment will include Self Contained Breathing Apparatus
(SCBA), First Aid Kits, Stretchers, and Hydrogen Sulfide Hand Operated Detectors. In the event of
an emergency, personnel should assemble at the up-wind SAFE BRIEFING AREA for instructions
from their supervisor.

6. Windsocks or streamers will be utilized to give wind directions at several elevations; i.e.,
tree top, derrick floor level, and 6 to 8 feet above ground level. PERSONNEL SHOULD
DEVELOP THE PRACTICE OF ROUTINE OBSERVATION OF WIND DIRECTION.

7. Windbreakers and rig curtains can be removed from around the derrick floor and monkey
board, if hazardous amounts of H2S encountered.

8. Explosion proof ventilating fans if required will be positioned to ensure adequate circulation
at the derrick floor, cellar area and any other location where hydrogen sulfide is accumulating in
excess of 10 PPM.

9 A kill line of ample strength and securely staked should be laid to the weil head from a safe
location to permit pumping into the weil in an emergency.

10. When approaching a depth where Hydrogen Sulfide may be encountered, the MUD
SHOULD BE MAINTAINED IN AN OVER BALANCED CONDITION TO restrict the Hydrogen
Sulfide to be treated to that contained in the formation drilled.

11. When approaching a depth where Hydrogen Sulfide may be encountered, appropriate
operational danger or caution sign(s) shall be displayed along ail controlled accesses to the site.

PHYSICAL EFFECTS OF HYDROGEN SULFIDE POISONING

THE PRINCIPAL HAZARD IS DEATH BY INHALATION. When the amount of gas absorbed into
the blood stream exceeds that which is readily oxidized, systemic poisoning results, with a general
action on the nervous system. Labored respiration occurs shortly, and respiratory paralysis may
follow immediately at concentrations of 700 ppm and above. This condition may be reached almost
without warning as the originally detected odor of Hydrogen Sulfide may have disappeared due to
olfactory paralysis. Death then occurs from asphyxiation unless the exposed person is removed
immediately to fresh air and breathing stimulated by artificial respiration. Other levels of exposure
may cause the following symptoms individually or in combinations:

a, Headache

b, Dizziness

c. Excitement

d. Nausea or gastro-intestinal disturbances

e. Dryness and sensation of pain in nose,
throat and chest

f. Coughing
g. Drowsiness

All personnel should be alerted to the fact that detection of Hydrogen Suifide solely by smell is
highly dangerous as the sense of smeil is rapidly paralyzed by the gas.

EFFECTS OF HYDROGEN SULFIDE ON METAL

Hydrogen Sulfide dissolves in water to form a weak acid that can cause some pitting, particularly in
the presence of oxygen and/or carbon dioxide. However, the most significant action of H2S is its
contribution to a form of hydrogen embrittlement known as sulfide stress cracking. Sulfide stress
cracking is a result of metals being subjected to high stress levels in a corrosive environment where
H2S is present. The metal will often fail catastrophically in a brittle manner. Sulfide stress cracking
of steel is dependent upon and determined by:

a. Strength (hardness) of the steel - the higher the strength, the greater the susceptibility to
sulfide stress cracking. Steels having yield strengths up to 95,UOO psi and hardness up to
Rce22 are generaily resistant to sulfide stress cracking. These limitations can be extended
slightly higher for properly quenched and tempered materiais.

b, Total member stress (load) - the higher the stress level (load) the greater the susceptibility
to sulfide stress cracking.

C. Corrosive environment - corrosive reactions, acids, bacterial action, thermal degradation, or
low PH fluid environment.

Use as protection against sulfide stresses cracking, all casing, BOP and safety equipment should
be of H2S resistant material.

TREATMENT FOR HYDROGEN SULFIDE POISONING

INHALATION
As Hydrogen Sulfide in the blood oxidizes rapidly, symptoms of acute poisoning pass off
when inhalation of the gas ceases. It is important, therefore, to get the victim of poisoning to
fresh air as quickly as possible. He should be kept at rest and chilling should be prevented.
lf respiration is slow, labored, or impaired, artificial respiration may be necessary. Most
persons overcome by Hydrogen Sulfide may be revived if artificial respiration is applied
before the heart action ceases. Victims of poisoning should be under the care of a
physician as soon as possible. Irritation due to sub-acute poisoning may lead to serious
complications such as pneumonia. Under those conditions, treatment by the physician
necessarily would be symptomatic. The patient should be kept in fresh air, and hygienic
conditions should be watched carefully.

CONTACT WITH EYES
Eye contact with liquid and/or gas containing Hydrogen Sulfide will cause painful irritation
(conjunctivitis). Keep patient in a darkened room, apply ice compresses to eyes, put ice on
forehead, and send for a physician. Eye irritation caused by exposure to Hydrogen Sulfide
requires treatment by a physician, preferably an eye specialist. The progress to recovery in
these cases is usually good.

CONTACT WITH SKIN
Skin absorption is very low. Skin discoloration is possible after contact with liquids
containing Hydrogen Sulfide. If such skin contact is suspected, the area should be
thoroughly washed.

DRILL STEM TEST

1. Drill Stem testing shall be done during daylight hours whenever practical. If it is necessary
to work under artificial light, levels shall be sufficient to allow employees to conduct the test safely.

2. Ammine Corrosion Inhibitor should be used to coat inside of drill pipe prior to conducting
Drill Stem Test in order to prevent Sulfide Stress Cracking.

3, If warranted, the use of Ammonia Hydroxide (26 Degree B'eaume Aqua Ammonia) for
neutralizing Hydrogen Sulfide from tubing or drill pipe can be used.

BLOWOUT PREVENTION EQUIPMENT

A kill line of ample strength and length should be laid to a safe point to allow pumping into
the well in an emergency situation.

The closing unit should be located a safe distance from the wellbore and positioned for
maximum utilization based on the prevailing wind direction.

BOP equipment will be tested in accordance with standard company practice.

All equipment should be H2S trimmed for service in sour gas environments.

All drill pipe and casing will be of a grade acceptable for H2S service.

proof light and siren).

One hand operated portable pump type (with low and high range H2S detector tubes.
One first aid kit.
One stretcher (Ferro folding).

Three juminous wind socks with frames and extension poles. Windsocks must be placed
so that they are visible by day and by night from all points on location.

One Flare Piston with 12 gauge meteor flares for igniting well.
One operating condition sign with flags at well entrance.
Condition | - Normal Operating Conditions (green flag);
Condition I! - Potential to Moderate Danger to Life (yellow flag);
Condition Il - Moderate to Extreme Danger to Life (red flag).
One fire bianket.

One warning light.

One warning siren.

NOTE: ADDITIONAL EQUIPMENT WILL BE ADDED IF WELL CONDITIONS REQUIRE OR

H2S SAFETY EQUIPMENT ON LOCATION

(PROVIDED BY THE SAFETY CONTRACTOR)

Two traffic cones.
Two compressed breathing air cylinders for briefing area number 2.
Briefing area stand

Briefing area number 2 sign.

UPON REQUEST

NOTE: Equipment for a maximum of sixteen (16) people on location.

Equipment will be rigged up and operational when drilling reaches a depth of 500 ft. above, or three
days, whichever is sooner, prior to penetrating the first zone containing or reasonably expected to

contain H2S.

IGNITING THE WELL

RESPONSIBILITY

THE DECISION TO IGNITE THE WELL IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE

DRILLING FOREMAN. In the event he is incapacitated, it becomes the responsibility of the Rig
Too! Pusher. This decision should be made only as a last resort and in a situation where it is clear
that:

1. Human life and property are endangered.

2. No hope exists for controlling the blowout under prevailing conditions at the well.

Notify the Oilfield Safety Inc. office, if time permits, but do not delay if human life is in danger.
Initiate first phase of evacuation plan.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR IGNITING THE WELL

1. Two people are required for the actual igniting operation. They must wear self-contained

breathing units and have a safety rope attached. One man will check the atmosphere for
explosive gases with the Explosimeter. The other man is responsible for igniting the well.

2. Primary method to ignite: Meteor-type Flare Gun.

3. Ignite upwind and do not approach any closer than is warranted.

4. Select the ignition site which is best for protection.

5. Select area for hasty retreat.

6. BEFORE FIRING, check regarding combustible gases.

7. Sinee Hydrogen Sulfide converts to Sulfur Dioxide, the area is not safe after igniting the
well.

8. After igniting, continue emergency action and procedure as before.

9, All unassigned personnel will limit their actions to only those directed by the Drilling
Foreman.

REMEMBER: AFTER WELL IS IGNITED, BURNING HYDROGEN SULFIDE WILL CONVERT TO
SULFUR DIOXIDE, WHICH IS ALSO HIGHLY TOXIC. DO NOT ASSUME THE AREA IS SAFE
AFTER THE WELL IS IGNITED.

MUD ADDITIVES

DRILLING FLUID RECOMMENDATION

An overbalanced mud should be used to drill potential pay zone with necessary additives for ail
stabilization.

In the event of H2S contamination of the mud system, Hydrogen Sulfide scavengers should be
added to the mud.

SPECIAL EQUIPMENT

lf a MUD-GAS SEPARATOR is installed, it will be installed with one or more flare lines.
Flare lines should be as long as practical and securely staked.

Flare Systems must be equipped with a safe and suitable means of ignition. The ignition
system must either be electrically or gas operated. Buckets of diesel fuel and torches are
no longer acceptable.

An automatic Hydrogen Sulfide monitor will be installed with a combination visual and
audible alarm system located where it can be seen and/or heard throughout the drilling
location. This system will have the capabilities of being activated from several points,
which are the rig floor, cellar, and shale shaker.

The automatic monitor should be set to trigger the drilling location visuai/audible alarms
when the Hydrogen Sulfide concentration in the atmosphere reaches 10 ppm. Explosion
proof lights and sirens will be provided at or near the rig floor and such that all personnel
will be subject to visual and audible warnings.

EMERGENCY DRILLS

Hydrogen Sulfide Alarm Drills

The Safety Advisor will conduct frequent H2S emergency drills for each crew by manually
activating the H2S detector. When the lights flash, all personnel on location will assemble at the
Upwind Briefing Area. A head count will be taken at this time to determine if rescue operations are
indicated. The Safety Advisor must be notified if more personnel are on location than during
normal operations. A “Masks On" policy will prevail until the all clear is sounded. These drills will
be implemented as frequently as required to familiarize all personnel with the procedures to be
followed in the event an actual emergency occurs.

System Automation through the proposed equipment will provide an independent control system on all equipment on site which will
be able to shut the well(s) in should any of the other equipment be incapacitated or functioning improperly.

Once the system is operational and linked to the CRI Williston Basin SCADA system, a notification will be sent directly to the
(Sidney, MT) field office, and field personnel in charge of the site’s operation. This system will also provide the capability for remote
shutdown from a computer terminal on the system at another location. In the event that an alert was sent from the site, or a call
received, CRI estimates that personnel would be able to respond to an incident through the remote system within minutes and be
present at the site within 15 to 30 minutes.

The purpose of this Contingency Plan is to outline the procedures that will be implemented by Cyclone
Drilling, Inc.’s Rig No. 20 personnel should a spill or flood occur during drilling activities conducted at the
Continental Resources, Inc. Atlanta 1-6H lease located in Section 6, 153N, 101W in Williams County,
North Dakota. Such procedures are designed to minimize the effects of spills and potential flooding on
Cyclone field personnel, Continental facilities, the surrounding community, and the environment in
general.

2. GENERAL INFORMATION

2.1 Equipment Description. Cyclone Drilling, Inc. operates drilling rigs that are moved from site to
site therefore, the exact equipment layout will vary slightly. The Atlanta 1-6H location
encompasses 3.1-acres and the standard equipment for most drilling jobs is as follows:

Mobile Rig (w/integrated fuel/oil storage tanks)

Storage Facilities

Mud Pumps (diesel-powered pumps w/integrated fuel storage tanks)
Generators (w/integrated fuel storage tanks)

Water Tanks

Pipe Racks

7,3. 3I335

2.2 Proximity of Rigs to Navigable Waters. According to 40 CFR 112.7(e)(6)(i), mobile drilling
equipment should be positioned or located so as to prevent spilled oil from reaching navigable
waters. Depending on the location, catch basins or diversion structures may be necessary to
intercept and contain fuel, crude oil, or oily drilling fluid spills.

The nearest potential receiving water for an oil spill is unnamed intermittent tributary of the
Missouri River located approximately 500-ft. south of the Atlanta 1-6 lease. A One-Mile Radius
Map indicating the location of Continental’s Atlanta 1-6H lease is included herein as Figure 1.

Cyclone personnel will locate Rig No. 20 and its associated equipment to best prevent a
potential release to waterways and provide drainage and containment, as discussed in Section
3.4 of this Plan. A Drilling Rig Layout Map is included herein as Figure 2.

2.3 Potential Spills and Releases. The spill prevention system includes visual inspections and
containment structures to help reduce the potential for releases to the off-site soil or surface
waters. Generally, minor spills or leaks within the work site will be contained by drip pans
located on skid-mounted equipment and cleaned-up using an absorbent (i.e., granular or pads).
A list of activities that represent the greatest potential for a release of oil to the environment is

as follows:
r Loading/unloading fuel, oil, and used oil to/from storage tanks and containers.
r Temporary storage of oil containers outside of secondary containment.

r Rigs that are operated without a fresh water or well fluids pit.

3. OIL/FUEL STORAGE

Oil, Fuel, and Used Oil Storage Tanks. The materials stored on-site are mainly used to operate
the drilling rig's generators and pumps and generally included the following:

Diesel Fuel
Engine Oil
Hydraulic Oil
Gear Oil
Used Oil

7,333

Container Storage. Multi-compartment storage containers are used to store hydraulic, motor
and gear oil in approximate 100- to 150-gal. capacities. These container is generally located
within the operating area near the accumulator valve skid. In lieu of such a multi-compartment
storage container, fresh oil may be stored in 55-gal. drums.

Used oil is stored in 55-gal. drums prior to contractor removal. Because of limited available
space within the rig's operating area, these drums are usually stored outside the operating area.
In this event, these drums will be placed in a spill containment pan or within an earthen berm.

Containers stored within the trenched operating area would be contained by drainage to the
well fluids pit. Containers used at sites that do not use pits are provided with earthen dike
containment or other containment (i.e., metal containment pan.) The containment volume for
containers located outside of the trenched operating area will be approximately 10% of the total
volume of all containers within the containment area.

Transfer Facilities. Fuel is transferred from bulk tanks into smaller day tanks located on the
drilling rig, pump skids, and generator skids. Most bulk fuel tanks are equipped with a fuel
pump attached to the skid. The fuel level in the day tanks is usually monitored until the tank is
full.

Personnel transfer fresh oil from bulk storage tanks or drums into smaller tanks located on the
drilling rig by filling 5-gal. buckets and manually filling the smaller tanks. Personnel transfer
used equipment oil into 55-gal. drums using 5-gal. buckets.

Cyclone personnel are present at all times during oil and diesel transfer operations to ensure
quick response in the event of a release. In addition, all pumps are securely grounded for static
electricity for safety and personnel protection purposes.

Drainage and Containment Facilities. The drains on containment systems will be closed and
sealed except during water drainage. Prior to draining water the following steps will be taken:

CONTINENTAL RESOURCES, INC. ATLANTA 1-6H
6-153N-101W, WILLIAMS County, NORTH DAKOTA

r Visually inspect the diked areas around tanks to ensure that the water does not exhibit
an oily sheen and will not result in a harmful discharge.

r Opening, closing, and locking the bypass valve under responsible supervision following
drainage activities.

r Maintain adequate drainage operation records.

3.5 Bulk Storage Tanks. The bulk storage tanks are located within a trenched area where releases
drain into the well fluids pit. The well fluids pit will be sized to provide containment volume to
accommodate the largest tank within the containment area as well as sufficient volume for
stormwater accumulation and the volume required for well fluid storage. Bulk storage tanks at
sites that do not use pits are contained by an earthen containment dike constructed around the
tank.

Stormwater that collects within the trenched area flows into the well fluids pit. Stormwater that
collects within the earthen dike containment structures is inspected and if no free oil or oil
sheen is observed, Continental field personnel or their on-site representatives may pump the
water outside of the containment structure. In the event oil is observed in the stormwater
within the earthen dike containment structures, it is pumped into a temporary container or
storage tank for off-site disposal.

3.6 Truck Loading/Unloading Areas. Cyclone personnel will use spill containment booms to contain
a release from a truck during loading/unloading operations or hand shovels and containment
booms to direct the release to a containment trench or pit. Collected oil from such a release will
be pumped into a temporary container or storage tank for off-site disposal.

4. FLOOD CONTINGENCY

Floods can develop slowly during an extended period of rain, or in a warming trend following a heavy
snow. Others, such as flash floods, can occur quickly, even without any visible signs of rain. It's
important to be prepared for flooding when working in a low-lying area, near water or downstream
from adam. The Atlanta 1-6H lease is located approximately 500-ft. north of an unnamed intermittent
tributary of the Missouri River at an approximate elevation of 1,953-ft. above Mean Sea Level (MSL). A
Well Location Map reflecting the topography of the subject site is presented herein as Figure 3.

4.1 Flood Watch. A Flood Watch indicates flooding is possible. Tune in to NOAA Weather Radio,
commercial radio, or television for information regarding potential timing of flooding. Begin
preparing to move portable equipment and storage tanks to higher ground. Anchor equipment
and storage tanks that cannot be readily moved.

4.2 Flash Flood Watch. A Flash Flood Watch indicates flooding may occur without warning. Be
prepared to move personnel, equipment, and portable storage tanks to higher ground; listen to
NOAA Weather Radio, commercial radio, or television for information.

Flood Warning. A Flood Warning indicates flooding is occurring or will occur soon; if advised to
evacuate, do so immediately, if safe to do so move equipment and portable storage tanks to
higher ground.

Flash Flood Warning. A Flash Flood Warning indicates flash flood is occurring; personnel should
seek higher ground on foot immediately.

Flood Evacuation Plan. In the event the Cyclone Drilling Foreman determines that the facility
must be evacuated due to flooding, they will notify the personnel concerned by verbally
announcing an evacuation or using internal two-way radios. All personnel will be required to
meet at the designated evacuation assembly area.

The Cyclone Drilling Foreman will account for all employees at the work site. In the event any

employees are missing, an immediate report will be made to the Safety Department. Good
judgment must be used in evacuation procedures to avoid placing people in greater danger.

5. PREPAREDNESS AND PREVENTION REQUIREMENTS

Preparedness and prevention is required for all spills and potential flooding. The Cyclone Drilling
Foreman will function as Emergency Coordinator and be responsible for establishing and implementing
the preparedness and prevention measures discussed in the following sections of this Plan.

5.1

5.2

5.3

5.4

Emergency Equipment. Cyclone Rig No. 20 located at the Atlanta 1-6H will be properly
equipped so that Cyclone personnel can immediately respond to an emergency during working
hours utilizing emergency equipment. Typical emergency equipment includes but is not limited
to fire extinguishers, eyewash stations, first-aid stations, and spill response equipment.
Employees will be trained and familiarized with the use and location of all emergency
equipment prior to beginning operations at a work site

Internal Communication. For larger jobs, Cyclone personnel use two-way radios to
communicate between the rig personnel and_ supervisor. For smaller jobs, verbal
communication is sufficient. During emergency situations, verbal communication and two-way
radios (if available) will be used to provide immediate instructions to emergency response
personnel. These systems are maintained, as necessary, to ensure proper operation during an
emergency.

External Communication. Telephones (available on some larger jobs) and cell phones are used
to notify Continental’s office in the event of an emergency. The office would telephone for
assistance from local emergency response personnel, if necessary. The phones are routinely
used to ensure proper operation.

Inspections. Inspections of oil storage units, containment, and emergency equipment are
conducted routinely to detect malfunctions and deterioration, operator errors, and/or

8. PLAN AMENDMENT
In the event that a reportable spill or flooding occurs, Cyclone personnel will review the event to
determine if an amendment to this Plan is necessary. In addition, Cyclone personnel will amend the
Plan whenever there is a modification in the facility design, construction, storage capacity, operation, or
maintenance that renders the existing Plan inadequate.
9. MANAGEMENT APPROVAL
This Contingency Plan has been prepared for operation of Cyclone Drilling, Inc.’s Rig No. 20 to be

reviewed prior to beginning operations at the Continental Resources, Inc. Atlanta 1-6 lease. The Plan
will be implemented as herein described.

discharges that may lead to, or cause a release of, oil from containment units or from the work
site.

Training. Cyclone personnel that are likely to respond to an incident are trained at least
annually in solid waste management, spill response procedures, and stormwater management
according to the procedures contained in this Plan. These employees are trained to perform ina
manner that emphasizes accident and pollution prevention in an effort to safeguard human
health and the environment.

The Cyclone Drilling Foreman is responsible for instructing appropriate personnel in the
operation and maintenance of spill response equipment as well as all applicable spill control
procedures. When employees are assigned to areas where oil spills may occur, it is required
that a review of this Contingency Plan be conducted during on-the-job training sessions.

Emergency Evacuation Plan. In the event the Cyclone Drilling Foreman determines that the
facility has experienced a release, fire, or explosion that could threaten human health, they will
notify the personnel concerned by verbally announcing an evacuation or using internal two-way
radios. All personnel in the immediate vicinity of the emergency will be required to leave the
area and report to his/her immediate supervisor at the designated evacuation assembly area.
The assembly area will be determined prior to beginning operations at a work site, but may
change based on wind direction during an actual emergency. The assembly area should be
upwind of the work site.

The Cyclone Drilling Foreman will account for all employees at the work site. In the event any

employees are missing, an immediate report will be made to the Safety Department. Good
judgment must be used in evacuation procedures to avoid placing people in greater danger.

6. EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROCEDURES

Emergency Response Procedures have been established for Cyclone’s work sites in the event of a spill.
All spills, major and minor, will be reported to the Cyclone Drilling Foreman and Continental’s
Environmental Specialist. The emergency response procedures are included in Appendix A. The
responsibilities of the First Responder, Cyclone Drilling Foreman, and Continental’s Environmental
Specialist are addressed in the following sections of this Plan.

6.1

6.2

First Responder. When a spill occurs, the employee observing the incident will immediately
notify the Cyclone Drilling Foreman and proceed to eliminate the spill source, if possible.

Emergency Coordinator Responsibilities. The Cyclone Drilling Foreman will (a) be responsible
for determining whether the release could reach navigable waters or threaten human health
and/or the environment; (b) assess the hazard, make immediate notifications, and implement
spill response procedures; (c) collect the necessary information for regulatory notifications and
reports; and (d) provide the reporting information to Continental’s Environmental Specialist.

CONTINENTAL RESOURCES, INC. ATLANTA 1-6H
6-153N-101W, WILLIAMS County, NORTH DAKOTA

Continental’s Environmental Specialist will make immediate verbal notifications and prepare
and submit all required written spill reports.

Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) for the hazardous materials used at the work site are
maintained on-site in the "doghouse" and provide information on the chemical hazards at the
work site. Most releases will be minor and require only clean-up and disposal of small
quantities of material. However, in the event the assessment indicates that evacuation of local
areas may be advisable, they will immediately notify appropriate local authorities, as necessary.
Appropriate authorities may include local police and fire departments, hospitals, and state and
local emergency response teams, as identified in Table 1.

The Cyclone Drilling Foreman will immediately notify Continental’s Environmental Specialist who
will make initial verbal notifications to regulatory agencies and prepare written follow-up
reports, as required. In the event the release has impacted the environment, the Cyclone
Drilling Foreman and Continental’s Environmental Specialist will determine clean-up
requirements. In addition, the Cyclone Drilling Foreman and Environmental Specialist will
coordinate the appropriate disposal of waste material generated during the response activities.

7. SPILL NOTIFICATION REPORTING

Spill Notification and Reporting. Upon receiving spill information, the Emergency Coordinator
will notify Continental’s Environmental Specialist who will determine if the spill requires
notification and/or reporting to regulatory agencies, as outlined below:

7.1.1. North Dakota Industrial Commission (NDIC). According to the North Dakota Industrial
Commission’s (NDIC) General Rules and Regulations North Dakota Administrative Code
(NAC) Chapter 43-02-03 Section C. Drilling:

All persons controlling or operating any well, pipeline, receiving tank, storage tank, or
production facility into which oil, gas, or water is produced, received, stored, processed,
or through which oil, gas, or water is injected, piped, or transported, shall verbally notify
the director within 24-hrs. after discovery of any fire, leak, spill, blowout, or release of
fluid. If any such incident occurs or travels offsite of a facility, the persons, as named
above, responsible for proper notification shall within a reasonable time also notify the
surface owners upon whose land the incident occurred or traveled. Notification
requirements prescribed by this section do not apply to any leak, spill or release of fluid
that is less than 1-bbl total volume and remains onsite of a facility. The verbal
notification must be followed by a written report within 10-days after cleanup of the
incident, unless deemed unnecessary by the director.

7.1.2. National Response Center (NRC). Any discharge to water must be reported immediately
to the National Response Center. Therefore, the Cyclone Drilling Foreman must
immediately Continental’s Environmental Specialist with details regarding the spill so
that official notifications can be made to the National Response Center.
