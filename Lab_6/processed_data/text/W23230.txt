DETAILS OF WORK

Oasis Petroleum North America LLC requests a waiver from the tubing/pkr requirement included in

NDAC 43-02-03-21: Casing, tubing, and cementing requirements during the completion period immediately
following the upcoming fracture stimulation.

The following assurances apply:

. The well is equipped with new 29# & 32# casing at surface with an API burst rating of 11,220 psi

. The frac design will use a safety factor of 0.85 API burst rating to determine the maximum pressure.

. Ciamage to the casing during the frac would be detected immediately by monitoring equipment.

. The casing is exposed to significantly lower rates and pressures during flow back than during the frac job.
. The frac fluid and formation fluids have very low corrosion and erosion rates.

. Production equipment will be installed as soon as possible after the well ceases flowing.

. A 300# gauge will be installed on the surface casing during the flowback period.

INTRODUCTION

Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC Ash Federal 5300 11-18T [Lot 1 Sec. 18, T153N R100W]
is located approximately 8 miles south and 2 miles east of the town of Williston in McKenzie
County, North Dakota. The Ash Federal 5300 11-18T is a horizontal Three Forks development
well in part of Oasis Petroleum’s Baker prospect (Baker Field) within the Williston Basin. The
vertical hole was planned to be drilled to approximately 10,328’. The curve will be built at 12
degrees per 100’ to land within the upper Three Forks. This well is a two section lateral which
originates in the northwest quarter of Section 18, then drills east to northeast quarter of Section
17 (Figure 2). Directional drilling technologies and geo-steering techniques will be used to land
in the Three Forks reservoir and maintain exposure to the ideal target rock.

OFFSET WELLS

The primary offset wells used for depth correlation during curve operations were the Gulf Oil
Exploration and Production Lindvig 1-11HR and the Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC.
Kline 5300 11-18H (Figure 3). The Gulf Oil Exploration and Production Lindvig 1-11HR [SE
SE Section 11, T153N, R101 W] is located approximately 1.5 miles west northwest of the Ash
Federal 5300 11-18T. This well was completed in March of 1982 and reached a total depth of
13,800’, true vertical depth (TVD). The Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC. Kline 5300 11-
18H [Lot 1 Section 18 TI53N, R100W] is located approximately 200’ south of the Ash Federal
5300 11-18T. This well was completed in October of 2011 and reached a total depth of 20,978’
MD. The formation thicknesses expressed by gamma signatures in these wells, and the Oasis
Petroleum North America, LLC Larry 5301 44-12B [SE SE Section 12, T153N, R101W] were
used to assist in landing the curve. This was accomplished by comparing gamma signatures from
the offset wells to gamma data collected during drilling operations. The casing target landing
true vertical depth (TVD) was periodically updated to ensure accurate landing of the curve. Data
used in this evaluation are found in this report.

Vertical Operations

The Ash Federal 5300 11-18T was spud on 23 August, 2012 by Nabors B22. A 13 4%” hole was
drilled with fresh water to 2,187’ and isolated with 9 %s” J-55 casing and cemented to surface.
After re-entry, the drilling fluid was diesel invert with target weight of 9.7-10.35 ppg for the
vertical hole and 10.0-10.35 ppg for curve operations. The vertical hole was drilled from surface
casing to the KOP of 10,335’ MD in 84.5 hours with bit #2, a Halliburton DX650, and a Baker
5/6 low speed motor.

Directional Operations

Ryan Energy Technologies provided personnel and equipment for MWD services in the vertical
hole, the curve, and throughout the lateral. The directional drillers (RPM), MWD and Sunburst
Consulting contractors worked closely together throughout the project to evaluate data and make
steering decisions to maximize the amount of borehole in the targeted zones and increase rate of
penetration (ROP) of the formation.

Curve Build

The curve was 781’ and was drilled in approximately 26 hours by bit #3, a 8 %4” Reed E1202-
A1B PDC bit, attached to a 2.38 degree adjustable National 7/8 5 stage mud motor. The curve
was successfully landed at 11,116’ MD, approximately 30’ below the base of the Lower Bakken
Shale. Seven inch diameter 32# HCP-110 and 29# HCP-110 casing were set to 11,101’ MD and
cemented.

Lateral

After completion of curve operations, MWD tools and bit #4, a 6” Baker T406X, 6 blade PDC
bit, attached to a 1.5° fixed Baker XL/LS 5/6 low speed motor were run in the hole. This
assembly drilled to 14,938’ MD, drilling 3,822’ in 69 hours in the lateral before the decision was
made to sidetrack due to excessive dog-legs. A new BHA consisting of MWD tools and bit #5 a
Security FX64D attached to a new 1.5° fixed Baker XL/LS 5/6 low speed motor were run in the
hole. This assembly drilled to 19,907’ MD, drilling 6,572’ in 149 hours before the MWD tool
ceased pulsing. A new BHA consisting of new MWD tools and bit #6 a Varel VM613P2
attached to a new 1.5° fixed Baker XL/LS 5/6 low speed motor were run in the hole. At
approximately 13,300’ during a sidetrack check, the MWD tool ceased pulsing and was
subsequently TOH. A new BHA with a new MWD tool and bit RR#6 and the previously run
motor were assembled and TIH. This assembly drilled to TD, drilling 575’ in 10.5 hours. Total
depth of 20,482’, with a final azimuth of 87.20° and inclination of 91.20° was achieved at 0416
hours CDT September 18, 2012. The resulting final vertical section was 9,898.23’.

The bottom hole location (BHL) is 28.91' north & 9,898.5' east of surface location or
approximately 771.09' FNL & 296.4' FEL, NE NE Sec. 17, T153N, R1OOW. The hole was then
circulated, and reamed for completion.

GEOLOGY
Methods

Geologic analysis for the Ash Federal 5300 11-18T was provided by Sunburst Consulting, Inc.
Information was networked through Rig-watch’s electronic data recorder system. This
information network provided depth, drilling rate, pump strokes and total gas units to multiple
areas throughout the well site. Gas data was fed from Sunburst’s digital gas detector, a total gas
chromatograph, through Rig-watch for dissemination. Hydrocarbon constituents (C; through C4)
were recorded in part-per-million concentrations. Gas sampling was pulled through 4” poly
tubing after agitation in Sunburst’s gas trap at the shakers. Rig crews caught lagged samples at
the direction of the well site geologists. Samples were collected at 30’ intervals in the
vertical/curve and 30’ intervals in the lateral. Rock cuttings were analyzed in wet and dry
conditions under a 10x45 power binocular microscope (for detailed lithologic descriptions see
appendix). Cuttings were sent to North Dakota Geologic Survey. In addition to rock samples,
rate of penetration and gamma ray data were also used in geologic analysis to aid geo-steering
and dip calculations.

Lithology

Formation analysis began at 8,110’ MD with a red orange siltstone and anhydrite characteristic
of the Kibbey Formation [Mississippian Big Snowy Group]. This interval consisted of a blocky,
red to orange, red brown, friable siltstone with calcareous cement moderately cemented with an
earthy texture. Also present was a trace amount of anhydrite which was off white. It was soft,
amorphous, with an earthy texture.

Figure 4. Limestone with spotty light brown & and dark brown dead oil staining in the Mission Canyon.

The Lodgepole Formation [Mississippian Madison Group] was encountered at 9,965' MD 9,964'
TVD (-7,886') SS. This interval was characterized by light to medium gray, dark gray,
argillaceous lime mudstone which was evidenced by the elevated gamma. The lithology was
further characterized as being microcrystalline, firm to a trace hard, and dense, with an earthy to
crystalline texture. Disseminated pyrite was also seen in the samples as a trace mineral. At
connections and downtime, gas shows of 165 to 587 units were noted in this formation.

The “False Bakken” [Lodgepole Formation] was drilled at 10,749' MD 10,689' TVD (-8,611')
SS, and the Scallion limestone at 10,751' MD 10,691’ TVD (-8,613’) SS. Samples from the False
Bakken are typically brown, black, shale, friable with an earthy texture. This facies is calcareous,
with a trace of disseminated pyrite. Due to the thin structure of the Scallion no samples were
collected. Gas levels were slightly elevated through this interval with a maximum of 262 units
likely due to fracture porosity.

The top of the Upper Bakken Shale Member [Mississippian] was drilled at 10,755' MD 10,695'
TVD (-8,617') SS. Entry into this interval was characterized by high gamma, elevated
background gas and increased rates of penetration. Unfortunately due to the thinness of this
formation and the angle of penetration a sample of this formation was not collected. Drilling gas
in this interval reached a maximum of 690 units.

The Bakken Middle Member [Mississippian-Devonian] was reached at 10,783' MD 10,709' TVD
(-8,631') SS. This formation was predominantly siltstone and silty sandstone noted by the
decreasing penetration rates, gamma units and recorded gas levels relative to the overlying
source rock. The siltstone was tan gray, friable, subplaty to subblocky, with an earthy texture. It
was moderately calcite cemented, with a trace of disseminated pyrite. Also present was silty
sandstone which was light gray, very fine grained, friable, subangular to subrounded, well sorted,
and contained possible intergranular porosity. It was moderately calcite cemented. Trace
minerals included disseminated and nodular pyrite. Drilling gas in this interval reached a
maximum of 503 units. Also observed was occasional dark brown spotty oil stain.

The Lower Bakken Shale Member [Devonian] reached at 10,880' MD 10,754' TVD (-8,676’') SS.
This was 13’ to the Kline 5300 11-18H. Entry into this interval was characterized by high


The Kibbey “Lime” came in at 8,347' MD 8,346' TVD (-6,268') subsea (SS). This marker is
represented by an anhydrite which was off white. It was soft, amorphous, with an earthy texture.
The anhydrite is often accompanied by slower penetration rates as the bit transitions out of the
overlying siltstone. The rate of penetration (ROP) then increases as the bit exits the anhydrite
into the underlying limestone mudstone. This carbonate was described as a light gray, light gray
brown, off white, lime mudstone which was microcrystalline, friable, and dense, with an earthy
texture. Samples in the lower section consisted of red to orange, red brown, light orange to off
white siltstone that was friable and blocky with an earthy texture. This facies was moderately
cemented with calcite and also was interbedded with soft, off white amorphous or
microcrystalline anhydrite.

The Charles Formation [Mississippian Madison Group] consisted of salt, anhydrite, limestone
and argillaceous lime mudstone. The first Charles salt was drilled at 8,492' MD 8,491' TVD
(-6,413') SS. The Base of the Last Salt (BLS) was logged at 9,188' MD 9,187' TVD (-7,109') SS
as indicated by slower penetration rates and increased weight on bit. The intervals of salt within
the Charles Formation can be identified by an increase in penetration rates and lower gamma
count. Samples of the salt intervals were described as clear frosted, crystalline, anhedral to rare
subhedral with a trace euhedral, and hard, crystalline in texture with no visible porosity. Slower
penetration rates are observed as the bit encounters sections of lime mudstone to wackestone,
which was cream, light gray to dark gray, microcrystalline, firm to hard, and dense, with an
earthy texture. This limestone was argillaceous in part and contained a trace of disseminated
pyrite. In areas where the penetration rates were slowest anhydrite was observed. These samples
were described as off white to white, soft with cryptocrystalline texture or amorphous. Within
the Charles Formation at 9,090’ MD slower penetration rates indicated the presence of anhydrite.
This section was approximately 14’ thick, its base, as indicated by the transition to faster
penetration rates and higher gamma counts is indicative of the Upper Berentson which was
drilled at 9,104' MD 9103 TVD (-7,025') SS.

The Ratcliffe interval [Charles Formation] was drilled at 9,221' MD 9,220' TVD (-7,142') SS.
The top of this interval was observed as faster penetration rates were encountered, as the well
bore transitioned from anhydrite and lime mudstone. This limestone was cream to light gray with
a trace of dark brown to a trace of medium brown. It was microcrystalline, firm, and dense; with
an earthy texture and a trace of disseminated pyrite. Also noted was anhydrite which was off
white, cryptocrystalline or amorphous with no visible porosity.

The Mission Canyon Formation [Mississippian Madison Group] was logged at 9,415' MD 9,414'
TVD (-7,336') SS. The Mission Canyon Formation consisted of lime mudstone. This limestone
facies was described as off white, light gray to gray, light brown, off white, blackish gray and
cream in color. The microcrystalline to crystalline structure was predominately friable to firm
with an earthy texture. Certain samples were a trace siliceous with rare a trace of sparry calcite
and a trace of disseminated pyrite. Fossil fragments, along with dark brown algal material were
visible in some intervals throughout the Mission Canyon Formation. At connections and
downtime, gas shows of 129 to 744 units were noted in this formation. A trace to rare dark
brown dead spotty oil stain was occasionally observed while logging the Mission Canyon
(Figure 4).


gamma, elevated background gas and increased rates of penetration. The shale is black, friable,
with an earthy texture and possible fracture porosity. Additionally the shale is described as
carbonaceous and petroliferous (Figure 5). Trace minerals included disseminated pyrite. Drilling
gas in this interval reached a maximum of 795 units with a connection gas of 894 units.

Figure 5. Sample of black, carbonaceous and petroliferous shale from the Lower Bakken Member.

The Pronghorn Member [Devonian-Bakken Formation] was reached at 10,913' MD 10,765' TVD
(-8,687') SS. Entry into this interval was characterized by lower gamma, and slightly slower
penetration rates. Samples from the Pronghorn were described as a siltstone which was medium
gray, friable, and subplaty to sub-blocky, with an earthy texture. The siltstone contained
dolomite cement moderately cemented and contained possible intergranular porosity. Trace
minerals included disseminated and nodular pyrite. Drilling gas in this interval reached a
maximum of 452 units with a connection gas of 509 units. A trace to rare light brown spotty oil
stain was occasionally observed while logging the Pronghorn.

The Three Forks Formation [Devonian] was reached at 10,966' MD 10,779' TVD (-8,701') SS.
The target zone of the Three Forks was to be drilled in the dolomitic facies in an eleven foot
zone beginning 10 feet into the Three Forks Formation (Figure 6).

Figure 6. Sample of shale and dolomite from high in Three Forks target zone on left; sample from the low
gamma low in zone dolomite and shale on right.

Samples in the Three Forks were generally dolomite which was tan, light brown, light pink to
pink, and off white (see Figure 6). Additionally this facies was microcrystalline, friable, with an
earthy to sucrosic texture; it also contained a trace of disseminated and nodular pyrite. Possible
intercrystalline porosity was observed, as was a common to a trace of light brown spotty oil
stain. Also present in varying amounts was a light green, light gray, shale. This shale was
friable, sub-blocky to subplaty, with an earthy texture. Also a trace of nodular and disseminated
pyrite was noted, and the shale contained no visible porosity.

Gas and Oil Shows

Gas monitoring and fluid gains provided evidence of a hydrocarbon saturated reservoir during
the drilling of the Ash Federal 5300 11-18T. Oil and gas shows at the shakers and in samples
were continuously monitored. In the closed mud system, hydrostatic conditions were maintained
near balance. This allowed for gas and fluid gains from the well to be monitored. Gas on the Ash
Federal 5300 11-18T varied according to penetration rates and stratigraphic position; with
generally higher gas liberated from the dolomite-dominated intervals characterized by low
gamma values (Figure 7). Observed concentrations ranged from 300 to 400 units of background
gas, and connection peaks of 300 to 600 units in earlier portion of the lateral where shows were
the best. In the later portion of the lateral flow was diverted through the gas buster, effectively
muting recordable gas values. A trip gas of 1,334 units at 13,335’ MD was observed, a later trip
at 19,907’ yielded a non- recorded 2,500 units of circulating gas. Chromatography of gas
revealed typical concentrations of methane, ethane, propane and butane (Figure 8).

Geo-steering

Geologic structure maps in the vicinity of the Ash Federal 5300 11-18T estimated 0.28 degree
down apparent dip for the first 4,000’ of the lateral. This apparent dip would then flatten slightly
for approximately 1,000’ then resume the 0.28 degree down dip until total depth (TD) was
reached. The Ash Federal 5300 11-18T preferred drilling interval consisted of an eleven foot
zone located approximately ten feet below the Pronghorn Member. Stratigraphic location in the
target zone was based on penetration rates, gas shows, gamma ray values and sample
observations. The projected target landing was to be eight feet into the Three Forks and was
successfully reached prior to casing operations. Using offsets provided by Oasis representatives,

projected porosity zones were identified as the preferred drilling areas (Figure 9).

Samples tended to contain a greater quantity of the light pink light brown dolomite, where
gamma values were lower. A greater quantity of the blue gray shale was observed in intervals
with higher gamma. In the lower portion of the target zone there was observed a thin layer of
dolomite that contained fair to good intercrystalline porosity and common spotty to even spotty
light to dark brown oil staining was observed. As noted earlier in this report Oasis personnel
decided not to drill near the claystone due to the problems during completions.

A TD of 20,482’ MD was achieved at 0416 hours CDT September 18, 2012. The well site team
worked well together maintaining the well bore in the desired target interval for 88% of the
lateral, opening 9,518’ of potentially productive reservoir rock. The bottom hole location (BHL)
lies: 28.91' north & 9,898.5' east of surface location or approximately 771.09' FNL & 296.4'
FEL, NE NE Sec. 17, TI53N, R100W. The hole was then circulated and reamed for completion.

Figure 9. CND type log gamma profile from the Lindvig 1-11HR used for target zone gamma character.

As the well bore moved from the top to the bottom of the preferred drilling zone gamma counts,
collected samples and gas were evaluated along with penetration rates to identify areas within the
11’ preferred drilling zone that yielded the best prospect potential (refer to Figure 10).

It should be noted that due to the west to east direction of the well-bore the survey and gamma
tools were positioned further back than normal. This positioning resulted in a delayed response
to the deflections of the well-bore and also resulted in a greater potential for dog-legs. Drilling in
the original well-bore was halted at 14,398’ MD, and a sidetrack was drilled beginning at
13,335’ MD as a result of severe dog-legs in the well-bore.

After beginning the lateral, Oasis representatives expressed a desire to remain in the upper
portion of the preferred drilling zone. Due to problems during completions associated with
hydraulic fracturing when the well-bore was positioned too close to the underlying claystone.

Drilling out of intermediate casing with the well-bore in the upper portion of the drilling zone,
gamma values ranged from 100 to 75 api. When moving down section, gamma counts ranged
from 50 to 60 api indicated that the well-bore had encountered a tight streak located in the
middle of the drilling zone. The well-bore deflected away from this tight streak many times
during the drilling of the Ash Federal 5300 11-18T. When in the top of the zone and moving
down onsite personnel adopted a strategy to avoid dog-legs. This policy was not to steer after the
gamma had dropped to between 50 and 60 api. Onsite staff would then monitor the well-bore and
make steering decisions based on the direction of the well-bore after it encountered the tight
streak. Gamma counts below the tight streak moving down would move first high to 90 to 100
api , then low to 30 to 80 api as the well-bore continued moving lower. If the well-bore entered
the underlying claystone gamma counts were recorded from 90 to 120 api. A new gamma tool
inserted towards the final portion of the lateral resulted in elevated gamma api values.

SUMMARY

The Ash Federal 5300 11-18T is a successful well in Oasis Petroleum’s horizontal Three Forks
development program in Baker Field. The project was drilled from surface to TD in 26 days. The
TD of 20,482’ MD was achieved at 0416 hours CDT September 18, 2012. The well site team
worked well together maintaining the well bore in the desired target interval for 88% of the
lateral, opening 9,518’ of potentially productive reservoir rock.

Samples in the Three Forks were generally dolomite which was tan, light brown, light pink to
pink and off white. Additionally this facies was microcrystalline, friable, with an earthy to
sucrosic texture. It also contained a trace of disseminated and nodular pyrite. Possible
intercrystalline porosity was observed, as was a common to a trace of light brown spotty oil
stain. Also present in varying amounts was light green and light gray shale. This shale was
friable, sub-blocky to subplaty, with an earthy texture. Also a trace of nodular and disseminated
pyrite was noted, and the shale contained no visible porosity.

Gas on the Ash Federal 5300 11-18T varied according to penetration rates and location of the
well bore in the stratigraphic column. In general higher gas response was recorded from the
dolomite-dominated intervals characterized by low gamma values. Observed concentrations
ranged from 300 to 400 units of background gas, and connection peaks of 300 to 600 units in the
earlier portion of the lateral where shows were the best. A trip gas of 1,334 units at 13,335’ MD
was observed, a later trip at 19,907’ yielded an observed 2,500 units of circulating gas.

The Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC. Ash Federal 5300 11-18T awaits completion
operations to determine its ultimate production potential.

LITHOLOGY

Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC Ash Federal 11-18T

Rig crews caught lagged samples, under the supervision of Sunburst geologists, in 30’ intervals from
8,140’ to 10,960’, 10’ intervals from 10,960’ to 11,110’, and then 30’ intervals to the TD at 20,482’ MD.
Sample or gamma ray marker tops have been inserted in the sample descriptions below for reference.
Samples were examined wet and dry under a binocular microscope. The drilling fluid was diesel-based
invert from surface casing to the TD of the curve at 11,110’, and salt water from 11,110’ to 20,482’ MD.

Location: LOT1 18-153-100 County: MCKENZIE
Permit Type: Development ~- HORIZONTAL
Vield: BAKER Target Horizon: THREE FORKS

Dear ROBIN E. HESKETH:

North Dakota Century Code (NDCC) Section 38-08-04 provides for the preservation of cores and samples and their
shipment to the State Geologist when requested. The following is required on the above referenced well:

1) All cores, core chips and samples must be submitted to the State Geologist as provided for the NDCC Section 38-
08-04 and North Dakota Administrative Code 43-02-03-38.1.

2) Samples shall include all cuttings from:

Base of the Last Charles Salt

Samples of cuttings shall be taken at 30' maximum intervals through all vertical, build and horizontal sections.
Samples must be washed, dried, packed in sample envelopes in correct order with labels showing operator, well
name, location and depth, and forwarded in standard boxes to the State Geologist within 30 days of the
completion of drilling operations.

3) Cores: ALL CORES cut shall be preserved in correct order, properly boxed, and forwarded to the State Geologist
within 90 days of completion of drilling operations. Any extension of time must have written approval from the
State Geologist.

4) All cores, core chips, and samples must be shipped, prepaid, to the State Geologist at the following address:

ND Geological Survey Core Library
Campus Road and Cornell
Grand Forks, ND 58202

5) NDCC Section 38-08-16 allows for a civil penalty for any violation of Chapter 38 08 not to exceed $12,500 for
each offense, and each day’s violation is a separate offense.

Sutvey Requirements for Horizontal, Horizontal Re-entry, and Directional Wells

NDAC Section 43-02-03-25 (Deviation Tests and Directional Surveys) states in part (that) the survey contractor shall file a
cettified copy of all surveys with the director free of charge within thirty days of completion. Surveys must be submitted as
one electronic copy, or in a form approved by the director. However, the director may require the directional survey to be
filed immediately after completion if the survey is needed to conduct the operation of the director's office in a timely manner.
Certified surveys must be submitted via email in one adobe document, with a certification cover page to certsurvey@nd.gov.
Survey points shall be of such frequency to accurately determine the entire location of the well bore.
Specifically, the Horizontal and Directional well survey frequency is 100 feet in the vertical, 30 feet in the curve (or when
sliding) and 90 feet in the lateral.

Surface casing cement

Tail cement utilized on surface casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi within 12 hours, and tail
cement utilized on production casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi before drilling the plug or
initiating tests.

Logs

NDAC Section 43-02-03-31 requires the running of a Cement Bond Log from which the presence of cement can be
determined in every well in which production or intermediate casing has been set and a Gamma Ray Log must be run from
total depth to ground level elevation of the well bore. All logs must be submitted as one paper copy and one digital copy in
LAS (Log ASCII) format, or a format approved by the Director. Image logs that include, but are not limited to, Mud Logs,
Cement Bond Logs, and Cyberlook Logs, cannot be produced in their entirety as LAS (Log ASCID) files. To create a
solution and establish a standard format for industry to follow when submitting image logs, the Director has given approval
for the operator to submit an image log as a TIFF (*.tif) formatted file. The TIFF (*.tif) format will be accepted only when
the log cannot be produced in its entirety as a LAS (Log ASCII) file format. The digital copy may be submitted on a 3.5”
floppy diskette, a standard CD, or attached to an email sent to digitallogs@nd.gov

Thank you for your cooperation.
Sincerely,

David Tabor
Engineering Technician IV

McKenzie County
Well File # 23230

Dear Brandi:

Pursuant to Commission Order No. 19840, approval to drill the above captioned well is hereby given. The approval is
granted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than the 500' setback from
the north & south boundaries and 200' setback from the east & west boundaries within the 1280 acre spacing unit
consisting of Sections 17 &18-T153N-R100W. Tool error is not required pursuant to order.

PERMIT STIPULATIONS: OASIS PETRO NO AMER must contact NDIC Field Inspector Richard Dunn at
701-770-3554 prior to location construction.

Drilling pit

NDAC 43-02-03-19.4 states that “a pit may be utilized to bury drill cuttings and solids generated during well drilling and
completion operations, providing the pit can be constructed, used and reclaimed in a manner that will prevent pollution of
the land surface and freshwaters. Reserve and circulation of mud system through earthen pits are prohibited. All pits shall be
inspected by an authorized representative of the director prior to lining and use. Drill cuttings and solids must be stabilized
in a manner approved by the director prior to placement in a cuttings pit.”

Form 1 Changes & Hard Lines

Any changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC. The
proposed directional plan is at a legal location. Based on the azimuth of the proposed lateral the maximum legal coordinates
from the well head is: 300’ N & 9994’ E.

Location Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period)

Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the approved
drilling permit on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report. If circumstances requite operations to commence before the 3rd
business day following publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may be waived by the Director.
Application for a waiver must be by sworn affidavit providing the information necessary to evaluate the extenuating
circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f), and any other information that would allow the Director to
conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the drilling permit, the applicant should retain the permit.

Permit Fee & Notification

Payment was received in the amount of $100 via credit card .The permit fee has been received. It is requested that
notification be given immediately upon the spudding of the well. This information should be relayed to the Oil & Gas
Division, Bismarck, via telephone. The following information must be included: Well name, legal location, permit number,
drilling contractor, company representative, date and time of spudding. Office hours are 8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and 1:00

Surveys are required at least every 30 feet in the build section and every 90 feet in the lateral section of a horizontal well. Measurement
inaccuracies are not considered when determining compliance with the spacing/drilling unit boundary setback requirement except in the
following scenarios: 1) When the angle between the well bore and the respective boundary is 10 degrees or less; or 2) If Industry standard
methods and equipment are not utilized. Consult the applicable field order for exceptions.

If measurement inaccuracies are required to be considered, a 2° MWD measurement inaccuracy will be applied to the horizontal portion of the well
bore. This measurement inaccuracy is applied to the well bore from KOP to TD.

REQUIRED ATTACHMENTS: Certified surveyor's plat, horizontal section plat, estimated geological tops, proposed mud/cementing plan,
