during January and February, 2015 in Baker Field, McKenzie County, North Dakota.
(G. Wayne Peterson, Sunburst Consulting)

INTRODUCTION

The Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC Chalmers 5300 21-19 11B [Lot 2 Section 19,
T153N, R1OOW] is located approximately 7 miles south of the town of Williston in McKenzie
County, North Dakota. The Chalmers 5300 21-19 11B is a horizontal Middle Bakken well within
the Williston Basin consisting of one 9,615' lateral drilled toward the east. The vertical hole was
planned to be drilled to approximately 10,230’. The curve would be built at 12 degrees per 100”
to land within the Middle Bakken. This well is a two section lateral which originates in the
northwest quarter of section 19, then drilled east to the southeast quarter of section 20.
Directional drilling technologies and geo-steering techniques were used to land in the Middle
Bakken reservoir and maintain exposure to the ideal target rock.

The Upper Bakken Shale [Mississippian-Bakken Formation] was drilled at 10,842' MD 10,728'
TVD (-8,652' SS). Entry into this member was characterized by high gamma, elevated
background gas and increased rates of penetration. The black to black gray carbonaceous and
petroliferous shale was hard with a sub blocky to sub platy texture. Fracture porosity was noted,
and trace minerals were observed to include disseminated pyrite and calcite fracture fill.
Hydrocarbons evaluated in this interval reached a maximum of 532 units drilling gas, with a
connection gas of 388 units.

Figure 3. Black carbonaceous and petroliferous shale from the Upper Bakken Shale.

The Middle Bakken [Mississippian-Devonian Bakken Formation] was reached at 10,884' MD
10,744' TVD (-8,668' SS) which was -1’ low to the Oasis Petroleum NA LLC Chalmers 5300
21-19 9B. The target zone of the Middle Bakken was to be drilled in a predominately 10 foot
zone beginning 12 feet below the Upper Bakken Shale.

Samples in the Middle Bakken were predominantly silty sandstone which was described as light-
medium brown, occasional light gray brown, rare light gray in color. It was very fine grained,
firm-friable, sub rounded to sub angular, smooth, moderately sorted, calcite cement, and
moderately cemented. A trace of disseminated and nodular pyrite was noted as was occasional
intergranular porosity. Also noted was common light to medium brown spotty to even oil stain.

Figures 4 and 5. Predominately silty sandstone sample from the target zone (left), and sample from below the
target zone (right).

OFFSET WELLS

Offset well data used for depth correlation during curve operations are found in the ‘Control
Data’ section appended to this report. Offset well control was essential in curve operations, to
successfully land within the Middle Bakken. Formation thicknesses expressed by gamma ray
signatures in these wells were compared to gamma data collected during drilling operations in
order to successfully land the curve. The target landing true vertical depth (TVD) was
periodically updated during drilling to ensure accurate landing of the curve.

GEOLOGY

The Charles Formation [Mississippian Madison Group] was logged 8,536' MD 8,535' TVD
(-6,459' SS). Samples in the lower portion of the Charles Formation consisted of a lime
mudstone, which was light brown, light gray brown, light gray brown, off white in color. It was
microcrystalline, friable, laminated, with an earthy texture. A trace of intercrystalline porosity
was observed as was occasional to rare spotty light brown oil stain. Occasionally noted was a
dolo-mudstone, which was light brown, light gray, light gray brown in color. It was
microcrystalline, friable-firm, laminated, with an earthy texture. Also noted was a trace of
intercrystalline porosity, and occasional spotty light brown oil stain. Rarely noted was anhydrite,
which was off white, cream in color. It was soft, microcrystalline, and massive with an earthy to
amorphous texture. Following connections or periods of non-circulation, gas peaks of 35 to 54
units were noted, as were drilling gas shows of 62 to 89 units.

The Mission Canyon Formation [Mississippian Madison Group] was logged 9,431' MD 9,430'
TVD (-7,354' SS). The Mission Canyon Formation consisted of a lime mudstone that was
described as light gray, light brown to brown, gray brown, trace dark gray in color. The lime
mudstone was predominately friable to firm, with an earthy to rarely crystalline in texture. Some
intervals contained a trace of black-brown algal material, a trace of fossil fragments, and traces
of disseminated pyrite. Also present was an argillaceous lime mudstone that was described as
light gray, occasional medium gray, rare gray tan, rare off white, trace dark gray in color. The
argillaceous lime mudstone was predominately firm to friable, crystalline to chalky texture.
Some intervals contained a trace of disseminated pyrite. Following connections or periods of
non-circulation, gas peaks of 35 to 191 units were noted, as were drilling gas shows of 40 to 109
units. Rare intercrystalline porosity was noted as well as traces to occasional spotty light brown
oil stain was occasionally observed while logging the Mission Canyon Formation.

Hydrocarbon Shows

Gas monitoring and fluid gains provided evidence of a hydrocarbon saturated reservoir during
the drilling of the Chalmers 5300 21-19 11B. Oil and gas shows at the shakers and in samples
were continuously monitored. In the closed mud system, hydrostatic conditions were maintained
near balance, this allowed for gas and fluid gains from the well to be evaluated. Gas on the
Chalmers 5300 21-19 11B varied according to stratigraphic position and penetration rates which
may have reflected increased porosity. During the vertical, connection gas peaks of 35 to 191
units were noted, as were drilling gas shows of 31 to 109 units, against a 10-11.5 lb/gal diesel-
invert mud weight. Background concentrations in the lateral ranged from 470 to 2,200 units,
against a 9.6-9.7 lb/gal saltwater gel drilling fluid. Connection peaks of 2,000 to 3,000 units were
observed, as were drilling gas shows of 2,500 units to 5,490 units coinciding with the best shows.
Drilling out of casing at 11,085 MD’ yielded a trip gas of 984 units. The lateral was completed
with one bottom hole assembly, consequently no other trip gasses were noted. Chromatography
of gas revealed typical concentrations of methane, characteristic of Middle Bakken Member gas.

position in the target zone. Using offset well data provided by Oasis representatives, projected
porosity zones were identified in the preferred drilling areas.

Figure 8. Offset well target definition, Indian Hills Prospect (Oasis).

Steering decisions were made by using gamma markers identified by Oasis representatives. The
high gamma (C) in the upper portion of the drilling zone was useful in identifying the well-bore
placement in formation. The slightly lower gamma (B) was observed as the well-bore moved to
the top of the target zone, followed by lower gamma as the well-bore moved higher, out of the
target zone. Low gamma in the middle of the target zone (D) was noted as the well-bore moved
to the middle of the target zone. As the well-bore moved lower in formation, the higher gamma
(E) was noted. Samples collected when drilling below the target zone tended to have a greater
concentration of the light gray to gray silty sandstone than did the samples collected when the
well-bore was higher in the target zone. The TD of 20,680’ MD was achieved at 14:30 hours
CST February 8, 2015. The well site team worked together to maintain the well bore in the
desired target interval for 90% of the lateral, opening 9,615’ of potentially productive reservoir
rock. During the drilling of the lateral to avoid unnecessary doglegs it was decided not to steer
the well-bore into the target zone for the sole purpose of reentering the target zone. The hole was
then circulated and reamed for completion.

SUMMARY

The Chalmers 5300 21-19 11B is a successful well in Oasis Petroleum’s horizontal Middle
Bakken development program in Baker Field. The project was drilled from surface casing to TD
in 16 days. The TD of 20,860’ MD was achieved at 14:30 hours CST February 8, 2015. The well
site team worked together to maintain the well-bore in the desired target interval for 90% of the
lateral, opening 9,615’ of potentially productive reservoir rock. During the drilling of the lateral
to avoid unnecessary doglegs it was decided not to steer the well-bore into the target zone for the
sole purpose of regaining the target zone.

Samples in the Middle Bakken were predominantly silty sandstone which was described as light-
medium brown, occasional light gray brown, rare light gray in color. It was very fine grained,
firm-friable, sub rounded to sub angular, smooth, moderately sorted, calcite cement moderately
cemented. A trace of disseminated and nodular pyrite was noted as was occasional intergranular
porosity. Also noted was common light to medium brown spotty to even oil stain.

Gas on the Chalmers 5300 21-19 11B varied according to stratigraphic position and penetration
rates which may have reflected increased porosity. The overall gas and hydrocarbon shows were
encouraging and indicate a hydrocarbon rich system in the Middle Bakken.

The Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC. Chalmers 5300 21-19 11B awaits completion
operations to determine its ultimate production potential.

Geosteering

Ryan Energy Technologies provided personnel and equipment for measurement-while-drilling
(MWD) services. The RPM directional drillers and MWD, and Sunburst Consulting personnel
worked closely together throughout the project to evaluate data and make steering decisions to
maximize the amount of borehole in the targeted zones and increase rate of penetration (ROP) of
the formation.

The 855’ curve was drilled in 23 hours. It was first drilled with a bottom hole assembly (BHA)
consisting of bit #3, a Ulterra U516M PDC bit, attached to a 2.38 degree fixed NOV 7/8 5.0
motor and MWD tools. Poor build rates caused this BHA to be replaced with bit # 4, a Smith
F30T Tri-cone bit attached to a 2.60 degree Cavare 6/7 5.0 motor. Excessive build rates caused
this assembly to be replaced. The previously run Cavare motor was adjusted to 2.45 degrees and
attached to bit #5, a Security MMD55M PDC bit. The curve was successfully landed at 11,085’
MD and 10,767’ TVD, approximately 23’ into the Middle Bakken. Seven inch diameter 32#
HCP-110 casing was set to 11,065’ MD.

Geologic structure maps of the Chalmers 5300 21-19 11B and surrounding control wells had
estimated formation dip to be a down dip at approximately -0.5° down to the TD of the lateral.
The preferred drilling interval of the Chalmers 5300 21-19 11B consisted of a 10 foot zone
located approximately 12 feet into the Middle Bakken. Penetration rates, gas shows, gamma ray
data, and sample observations were utilized to keep the wellbore in the preferred stratigraphic

LITHOLOGY

Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC
Chalmers 5300 21-19 11B

Rig crews caught 30’ sample intervals, under the supervision of Sunburst geologists, from 8,240’ to the TD of the
lateral at 20,680’. Formation tops and lithologic markers have been inserted into the sample descriptions below
for reference. Sample descriptions begin in the Kibbey Formation just prior to the Kibbey Lime. Samples were
examined wet and dry under a binocular microscope. Sample fluorescent cuts are masked by invert mud through
intermediate casing. Quantifiers in order of increasing abundance are trace, rare, occasional, common and
abundant.

LOT2 Section 19-153N-100W
McKenzie County
Well File # 28649
Dear Brandi:

Pursuant to Commission Order No. 23752, approval to drill the above captioned well is hereby given. The
approval is granted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than
the 500' setback from the north & south boundaries and 200' setback from the east & west boundaries within the
1280 acre spacing unit consisting of Sections 19 &20 T153N R100W.

PERMIT STIPULATIONS: Effective June 1, 2014, a covered leak-proof container (with placard) for
filter sock disposal must be maintained on the well site beginning when the well is spud, and must
remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations are
conducted. Due to the proximity of Lake Sakakawea to the well site, a dike is required surrounding the
entire location. OASIS PETRO NO AMER must contact NDIC Field Inspector Richard Dunn at 701-
770-3554 prior to location construction.

Drilling pit

NDAC 43-02-03-19.4 states that “a pit may be utilized to bury drill cuttings and solids generated during well
drilling and completion operations, providing the pit can be constructed, used and reclaimed in a manner that will
prevent pollution of the land surface and freshwaters. Reserve and circulation of mud system through earthen pits
are prohibited. All pits shall be inspected by an authorized representative of the director prior to lining and use.
Drill cuttings and solids must be stabilized in a manner approved by the director prior to placement in a cuttings

pit.”

Form 1 Changes & Hard Lines

Any changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC.
The proposed directional plan is at a legal location. Based on the azimuth of the proposed lateral the maximum
legal coordinate from the well head is: 9963’ east.

Location Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period)

Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the
approved drilling permit on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report. If circumstances require operations to
commence before the 3rd business day following publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may
be waived by the Director. Application for a waiver must be by sworn affidavit providing the information
necessary to evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f, and any other
information that would allow the Director to conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the
drilling permit, the applicant should retain the permit.

Oasis Petroleum North America LLC requests permission for suspension of drilling for up to 90 days for the
referenced well under NDAC 43-02-03-55. Oasis Petroleum North America LLC intends to drill the surface hole with
freshwater based drilling mud and set surface casing with a small drilling rig and move off within 3 to 5 days. The
casing will be set at a depth pre-approved by the NDIC per the Application for Permit to Drill NDAC 43-02-03-21. No
saltwater will be used in the drilling and cementing operations of the surface casing. Once the surface casing is
cemented, a plug or mechanical seal will be placed at the top of the casing to prevent any foreign matter from getting
into the well. A rig capable of drilling to TD will move onto the location within the 90 days previously outlined to
complete the drilling and casing plan as per the APD. The undersigned states that this request for suspension of
drilling operations in accordance with the Subsection 4 of Section 43-02-03-55 of the NDAC, is being requested to
take advantage of the cost savings and time savings of using an initial rig that is smaller than the rig necessary to
drill a well to total depth but is not intended to alter or extend the terms and conditions of, or suspend any obligation
under, any oil and gas lease with acreage in or under the spacing or drilling unit for the above-referenced well. Oasis
Petroleum North America LLC understands NDAC 43-02-03-31 requirements regarding confidentiality pertaining to
this permit. The drilling pit will be fenced immediately after construction if the well pad is located in a pasture (NDAC
43-02-03-19 & 19.1). Oasis Petroleum North America LL will plug and abandon the well and reclaim the well site if the
well is not drilled by the larger rotary rig within 90 days after spudding the well with the smaller drilling rig.

Survey Requirements for Horizontal, Horizontal Re-entry, and Directional Wells

NDAC Section 43-02-03-25 (Deviation Tests and Directional Surveys) states in part (that) the survey contractor
shall file a certified copy of all surveys with the director free of charge within thirty days of completion. Surveys
must be submitted as one electronic copy, or in a form approved by the director. However, the director may
require the directional survey to be filed immediately after completion if the survey is needed to conduct the
operation of the director's office in a timely manner. Certified surveys must be submitted via email in one adobe
document, with a certification cover page to certsurvey@nd.gov.
Survey points shall be of such frequency to accurately determine the entire location of the well bore.
Specifically, the Horizontal and Directional well survey frequency is 100 feet in the vertical, 30 feet in the curve
(or when sliding) and 90 feet in the lateral.

Surface casing cement

Tail cement utilized on surface casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi within 12
hours, and tail cement utilized on production casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi
before drilling the plug or initiating tests.

Logs

NDAC Section 43-02-03-31 requires the running of (1) a suite of open hole logs from which formation tops and
porosity zones can be determined, (2) a Gamma Ray Log run from total depth to ground level elevation of the well bore, and
(3) a log from which the presence and quality of cement can be determined (Standard CBL or Ultrasonic cement evaluation
log) in every well in which production or intermediate casing has been set, this log must be run prior to completing the well.
All logs run must be submitted free of charge, as one digital TIFF (tagged image file format) copy and one digital LAS (log

RE: Filter Socks and Other Filter Media
Leakproof Container Required
Oil and Gas Wells

Dear Operator,

North Dakota Administrative Code Section 43-02-03-19.2 states in part that all waste material associated with
exploration or production of oil and gas must be properly disposed of in an authorized facility in accord with all
applicable local, state, and federal laws and regulations.

Filtration systems are commonly used during oil and gas operations in North Dakota. The Commission is very
concerned about the proper disposal of used filters (including filter socks) used by the oil and gas industry.

Effective June 1, 2014, a container must be maintained on each well drilled in North Dakota beginning when the
well is spud and must remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations
are conducted. The on-site container must be used to store filters until they can be properly disposed of in an
authorized facility. Such containers must be:

e leakproof to prevent any fluids from escaping the container

e covered to prevent precipitation from entering the container

e placard to indicate only filters are to be placed in the container

If the operator will not utilize a filtration system, a waiver to the container requirement will be considered, but
only upon the operator submitting a Sundry Notice (Form 4) justifying their request.

As previously stated in our March 13, 2014 letter, North Dakota Administrative Code Section 33-20-02.1-01
states in part that every person who transports solid waste (which includes oil and gas exploration and production
wastes) is required to have a valid permit issued by the North Dakota Department of Health, Division of Waste
Management. Please contact the Division of Waste Management at (701) 328-5166 with any questions on the
solid waste program. Note oil and gas exploration and production wastes include produced water, drilling mud,
invert mud, tank bottom sediment, pipe scale, filters, and fly ash.

Thank you for your cooperation.

Sincerely,

Brace E. Fichs

Re: | Un-Occupied Trailer House and Seasonal Cabin.

Brandi,

Just to follow up with past conversations about the dwellings east of our proposed Chalmer
5300 21-19 well site. The white trailer is unlivable, it has no water, power or sewer. The cabin
is seasonal at best and has not been used for several years. If | can be of further assistance

please advise.
