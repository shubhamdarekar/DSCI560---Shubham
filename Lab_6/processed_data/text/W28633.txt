INTRODUCTION

The Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC Chalmers 5300 21-19 5T [Lot 2 Section 19,
TI53N, R1O0W] is located approximately 7 miles south of the town of Williston in McKenzie
County, North Dakota. The Chalmers 5300 21-19 5T is a horizontal Three Forks well within the
Williston Basin consisting of one 9,730" lateral drilled toward the east. The vertical hole was
planned to be drilled to approximately 10,341’. The curve would be built at 12 degrees per 100”
to land within the Three Forks. This well is a two section lateral which originates in the
northwest quarter of section 19, then drilled east to the northeast quarter of section 20.
Directional drilling technologies and geo-steering techniques were used to land in the Three
Forks reservoir and maintain exposure to the ideal target rock.

Oasis Petroleum North America LLC requests a variance to NDAC 43-02-03-21 for the tubing/packer requirement:
Casing, tubing, and cementing requirements during the completion period immediately following the upcoming
fracture stimulation.

The following assurances apply:

1. the well is equipped with new 29# and 32# casing at surface with an API burst rating of 11,220 psi;

2. The Frac design will ise a safety factor of 0.85 API burst rating to determine the maximum pressure;

3. Damage to the casing during the frac would be detected immediately by montioring equipement;

4. The casing is exposed to significantly lower rates and pressures during flowback than during the frac job;
5. The frac fluid and formation fluids have very low corrosion and erosion rates;

6. Production equipment will be installed as soon as possible after the well ceases flowing;

7. A 300# gauge will be installed on the surface casing during the flowback period

OFFSET WELLS

Offset well data used for depth correlation during curve operations are found in the ‘Control
Data’ section appended to this report. Offset well control was essential in curve operations, to
successfully land within the Three Forks. Formation thicknesses expressed by gamma ray
signatures in these wells were compared to gamma data collected during drilling operations in
order to successfully land the curve. The target landing true vertical depth (TVD) was
periodically updated during drilling to ensure accurate landing of the curve.

GEOLOGY

The Charles Formation [Mississippian Madison Group] was logged 8,535' MD 8,534 TVD
(-6,458' SS). Samples in the lower portion of the Charles Formation consisted of a limestone
mudstone, which was light brown, light gray brown, off white in color. It was microcrystalline,
friable, laminated, with an earthy texture. A trace of intercrystalline porosity, as was rare spotty
light brown oil stain Occasionally noted was a dolomite mudstone, which was light brown, light
gray brown in color. It was microcrystalline, friable-firm, laminated, with an earthy texture. Also
noted was a trace of intercrystalline porosity, and occasional spotty light brown oil stain. Rarely
noted was anhydrite, which was off white, cream in color. It was soft, microcrystalline, and
massive with an earthy to amorphous texture. Following connections or periods of non-
circulation, gas peaks of 12 to 33 units were noted, as were drilling gas shows of 15 to 36 units.

The Mission Canyon Formation [Mississippian Madison Group] was logged 9,432' MD 9,431'
TVD (-7,355' SS). The Mission Canyon Formation consisted of a lime mudstone that was
described as light gray, light brown, gray brown, trace dark gray in color. The lime mudstone
was predominately friable to firm, with an earthy to rarely crystalline in texture. Some intervals
contained a trace of black-brown algal material, a trace of fossil fragments, and traces of
disseminated pyrite. Also present was an argillaceous lime mudstone that was described as light
gray, occasional medium gray, rare gray tan, rare off white, trace dark gray in color. The
argillaceous lime mudstone — was
predominately firm to friable, crystalline
to chalky texture. Some _ intervals
contained a trace of disseminated pyrite.
Following connections or periods of non-
circulation, gas peaks of 28 to 45 units
were noted, as were drilling gas shows of
35 to 83 units. Rare intercrystalline
porosity was noted as well as traces to
occasional spotty light brown oil stain was
occasionally observed while logging the
Mission Canyon Formation.

Figure 2. Limestone with spotty light to medium brown
staining from the Mission Canyon Formation.

Samples in the Three Forks were predominantly dolomite which was described as light brown-
light brown gray, tan-cream, trace pink in color. It was firm, laminated, with a microsucrosic
texture. Rare disseminated pyrite was noted as was occasional intercrystalline porosity. Also
noted was common spotty to rare even light brown oil stain. Also observed was light green-light
gray green, mint green shale that was firm, subblocky, with an earthy texture. Occasional
disseminated pyrite was noted as was possible intergranular porosity.

Figures 4, 5, & 6. A predominately dolomitic sample low in the preferred drilling zone of the Three Forks
(left); a predominately dolomitic sample high in the preferred drilling zone of the Three Forks (middle); and
sample of the underlying claystone (right).

Gas Show

Gas monitoring and fluid gains provided evidence of a hydrocarbon saturated reservoir during
the drilling of the Chalmers 5300 21-19 5ST. Oil and gas shows at the shakers and in samples
were continuously monitored. In the closed mud system, hydrostatic conditions were maintained
near balance, this allowed for gas and fluid gains from the well to be evaluated. Gas on the
Chalmers 5300 21-19 5T varied according to stratigraphic position and penetration rates which
may have reflected increased porosity. During the vertical, connection gas peaks of 12 to 45
units were noted, as were drilling gas shows of 12 to 83 units, against a 10.34-11.4 lb/gal diesel-
invert mud weight. Background concentrations in the lateral ranged from 100 to 1,800 units,
against a 9.65-9.75 lb/gal saltwater gel drilling fluid. Connection peaks of 400 to 800 units were
observed, coinciding with the best shows. Drilling out of casing at 11,198 MD’ yielded a trip gas
of 2,259 units, and trips at 17,104’ MD, and 17,182’ MD and 19,990’ MD yielded trip gas of
4,819 units, and 1,618 units, respectively. After a trip at 19,990’ MD, due to problems associated
with the extreme cold weather the flow was diverted from the shakers and no trip gasses were
noted. Chromatography of gas revealed typical concentrations of methane, characteristic of
Three Forks gas.

Total Gas, ROP x 50, Gamma Ray x 2

The Upper Shale Member [Mississippian-Bakken Formation] was drilled at 10,790' MD 10,726'
TVD (-8,650' SS). Entry into this member was characterized by high gamma, elevated
background gas and increased rates of penetration. The black to black gray carbonaceous and
petroliferous shale was hard with a splintery to smooth texture. Fracture porosity was noted, and
trace minerals were observed to include disseminated pyrite and calcite fracture fill.
Hydrocarbons evaluated in this interval reached a maximum of 546 units drilling gas, with a
connection gas of 552 units.

The Middle Member [Mississippian-Devonian Bakken Formation] was drilled at 10,820' MD
10,742' TVD (-8,666' SS). Samples in the Middle Bakken Member were predominantly silty
sandstone which was described as light gray brown, light brown, trace light gray in color. It was
very fine grained, friable, subround, smooth, moderately sorted, with calcite cement, moderately
cemented. A trace of disseminated and nodular pyrite was noted as was fair intergranular
porosity. Also noted was common light to medium brown spotty to even oil stain. Hydrocarbons
evaluated in this interval reached a maximum of 118 units drilling gas, with a survey gas of 80
units.

The Lower Shale Member [Mississippian-Bakken Formation] was drilled at 10,898' MD 10,783'
TVD (-8,707' SS). Entry into this interval was characterized by high gamma, elevated
background gas and increased rates of penetration. The carbonaceous black, black gray shale is
petroliferous, hard, splintery, smooth and exhibits possible fracture porosity. Trace minerals
included disseminated pyrite. Drilling gas in this interval reached a maximum of 132 units.

The Pronghorn Member  [Devonian-
Bakken Formation] was reached at 10,930'
MD 10,795' TVD (-8,719' SS). Entry into
this interval was characterized by lower
gamma, and slightly slower penetration
rates. Samples from the Pronghorn were
described as siltstone which was dark gray
trace gray black, friable to firm, subblocky
to subsplit. This siltstone was moderately
dolomite cemented and __ included
disseminated and nodular pyrite. Also
noted was a trace of spotty light brown oil
stain. Drilling gas in this interval reached
a maximum of 94 units with a survey gas
of 76 units.

Geosteering

Ryan Energy Technologies provided personnel and equipment for measurement-while-drilling
(MWD) services. The RP directional drillers and MWD, and Sunburst Consulting personnel
worked closely together throughout the project to evaluate data and make steering decisions to
maximize the amount of borehole in the targeted zones and increase rate of penetration (ROP) of
the formation.

The 913’ curve was drilled in 23 hours with a bottom hole assembly (BHA) consisting of bit #4,
a Security MMD55M PDC bit, attached to a 2.38 degree fixed NOV 7/8 5.0 motor and MWD
tools. The curve was successfully landed at 11,198’ MD and 10,834’ TVD, approximately 21’
into the Three Forks Formation. Seven inch diameter 32# HCP-110 casing was set to 11,150’
MD.

Geologic structure maps of the Chalmers 5300 21-19 5T and surrounding control wells had
estimated formation dip to be a down dip at approximately -0.5° down to the TD of the lateral.
The preferred drilling interval of the Chalmers 5300 21-19 5T consisted of a ten foot zone
located approximately sixteen feet into the Three Forks Formation. Penetration rates, gas shows,
gamma ray data, and sample observations were utilized to keep the wellbore in the preferred
stratigraphic position in the target zone. Using offset well data provided by Oasis representatives,
projected porosity zones were identified in the preferred drilling areas.

True Stratgraphic Postion

Figure 9. Offset Well Target Definition, Indian Hills Prospect (Oasis).

Steering decisions were made by using the low gamma in the lower portion of the target zone to
establish the well-bore’s position in the target zone. If the well-bore moved lower, the higher
gamma of the underlying claystone (G) was observed, as was the presence of claystone in
collected samples. Slides were then utilized to move the well-bore back up into the target zone.
As the well-bore moved higher, approaching the top of the target zone the high to medium
fluctuating gamma (D) was noted. Samples in the lower gamma portion of the target zone
contained noticeably greater concentrations of the light brown-light brown gray, tan-cream, trace
pink dolomite; as the well-bore moved higher in zone the samples tended to have more of the
light gray, off white, gray brown dolomite. The TD of 20,928’ MD was achieved at 03:30 hours
CDT December 1, 2014. The well site team worked together to maintain the well bore in the

SUMMARY

The Chalmers 5300 21-19 5T is a successful well in Oasis Petroleum’s horizontal Three Forks
development program in Baker Field. The project was drilled from surface casing to TD in 26
days. The TD of 20,928’ MD was achieved at 03:30 hours CST December 1, 2014. The well site
team worked together to maintain the well bore in the desired target interval for 72% of the
lateral, opening 9,730’ of potentially productive reservoir rock.

Samples in the Three Forks were predominantly dolomite which was described as light brown-
light brown gray, tan-cream, trace pink in color. It was firm, laminated, with a microsucrosic
texture. Rare disseminated pyrite was noted as was occasional intercrystalline porosity. Also
noted was common spotty to rare even light brown oil stain. Also observed was light green-light
gray green, mint green shale that was firm, subblocky, with an earthy texture. Occasional
disseminated pyrite was noted as was possible intergranular porosity.

Gas on the Chalmers 5300 21-19 5T varied according to stratigraphic position and penetration
rates which may have reflected increased porosity. The overall gas and hydrocarbon shows were
encouraging and indicate a hydrocarbon rich system in the Three Forks.

The Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC. Chalmers 5300 21-19 S5T awaits completion
operations to determine its ultimate production potential.

LITHOLOGY
Chalmers 5300 21-19 5T

Rig crews caught 30’ sample intervals, under the supervision of Sunburst geologists, from 8,240’ to the TD of the lateral at
20,928’. Formation tops and lithologic markers have been inserted into the sample descriptions below for reference. Sample
descriptions begin in the Kibbey Formation just prior to the Kibbey Lime. Samples were examined wet and dry under a
binocular microscope. Sample fluorescent cuts are masked by invert mud through intermediate casing. Quantifiers in order
of increasing abundance are trace, rare, occasional, common and abundant.

DETAILS OF WORK

Oasis Petroleum North America LLC requests permission for suspension of drilling for up to 90 days for the
referenced well under NDAC 43-02-03-55. Oasis Petroleum North America LLC intends to drill the surface hole with
freshwater based drilling mud and set surface casing with a small drilling rig and move off within 3 to 5 days. The
casing will be set at a depth pre-approved by the NDIC per the Application for Permit to Drill NDAC 43-02-03-21. No
saltwater will be used in the drilling and cementing operations of the surface casing. Once the surface casing is
cemented, a plug or mechanical seal will be placed at the top of the casing to prevent any foreign matter from getting
into the well. A rig capable of drilling to TD will move onto the location within the 90 days previously outlined to
complete the drilling and casing plan as per the APD. The undersigned states that this request for suspension of
drilling operations in accordance with the Subsection 4 of Section 43-02-03-55 of the NDAC, is being requested to
take advantage of the cost savings and time savings of using an initial rig that is smaller than the rig necessary to
drill a well to total depth but is not intended to alter or extend the terms and conditions of, or suspend any obligation
under, any oil and gas lease with acreage in or under the spacing or drilling unit for the above-referenced well. Oasis
Petroleum North America LLC understands NDAC 43-02-03-31 requirements regarding confidentiality pertaining to
this permit. The drilling pit will be fenced immediately after construction if the well pad is located in a pasture (NDAC
43-02-03-19 & 19.1). Oasis Petroleum North America LL will plug and abandon the well and reclaim the well site if the
well is not drilled by the larger rotary rig within 90 days after spudding the well with the smaller drilling rig.

McKenzieCounty
Well File # 28633
Dear Brandi:

Pursuant to Commission Order No. 23752, approval to drill the above captioned well is hereby given. The
approval is granted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than
the 500' setback from the north & south boundaries and 200' setback from the east & west boundaries within the
1280 acre spacing unit consisting of Sections 19 & 20 T153N R100W.

PERMIT STIPULATIONS: Due to the proximity of Lake Sakakawea to the well site, a dike is required
surrounding the entire location. Effective June 1, 2014, a covered leak-proof container (with placard) for
filter sock disposal must be maintained on the well site beginning when the well is spud, and must
remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations are
conducted. OASIS PETRO NO AMER must contact NDIC Field Inspector Richard Dunn at 701-770-
3554 prior to location construction.

Drilling pit

NDAC 43-02-03-19.4 states that “a pit may be utilized to bury drill cuttings and solids generated during well
drilling and completion operations, providing the pit can be constructed, used and reclaimed in a manner that will
prevent pollution of the land surface and freshwaters. Reserve and circulation of mud system through earthen pits
are prohibited. All pits shall be inspected by an authorized representative of the director prior to lining and use.
Drill cuttings and solids must be stabilized in a manner approved by the director prior to placement in a cuttings

pit.”

Form 1 Changes & Hard Lines

Any changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC.
The proposed directional plan is at a legal location. Based on the azimuth of the proposed lateral the maximum
legal coordinate from the well head is: 9971’ east.

Location Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period)

Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the
approved drilling permit on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report. If circumstances require operations to
commence before the 3rd business day following publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may
be waived by the Director. Application for a waiver must be by sworn affidavit providing the information
necessary to evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f, and any other
information that would allow the Director to conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the
drilling permit, the applicant should retain the permit.

exploration or production of oil and gas must be properly disposed of in an authorized facility in accord with all
applicable local, state, and federal laws and regulations.

Filtration systems are commonly used during oil and gas operations in North Dakota. The Commission is very
concerned about the proper disposal of used filters (including filter socks) used by the oil and gas industry.

Effective June 1, 2014, a container must be maintained on each well drilled in North Dakota beginning when the
well is spud and must remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations
are conducted. The on-site container must be used to store filters until they can be properly disposed of in an
authorized facility. Such containers must be:

e leakproof to prevent any fluids from escaping the container

e covered to prevent precipitation from entering the container

e placard to indicate only filters are to be placed in the container

If the operator will not utilize a filtration system, a waiver to the container requirement will be considered, but
only upon the operator submitting a Sundry Notice (Form 4) justifying their request.

As previously stated in our March 13, 2014 letter, North Dakota Administrative Code Section 33-20-02.1-01
states in part that every person who transports solid waste (which includes oil and gas exploration and production
wastes) is required to have a valid permit issued by the North Dakota Department of Health, Division of Waste
Management. Please contact the Division of Waste Management at (701) 328-5166 with any questions on the
solid waste program. Note oil and gas exploration and production wastes include produced water, drilling mud,
invert mud, tank bottom sediment, pipe scale, filters, and fly ash.

Thank you for your cooperation.

Sincerely,

Brace E. Fichs

Re: | Un-Occupied Trailer House and Seasonal Cabin.

Brandi,

Just to follow up with past conversations about the dwellings east of our proposed Chalmer
5300 21-19 well site. The white trailer is unlivable, it has no water, power or sewer. The cabin
is seasonal at best and has not been used for several years. If | can be of further assistance

please advise.
