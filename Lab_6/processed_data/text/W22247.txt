Rod String: Norris 78s with a 86 taper and 2” plunger pump. See WBD for details,
Problems/History: Drill rig lost circulation in Mission Canyon, ran an ECP to pack off above Mission

Canyon for the second stage of the cement job. CBL does not show cement above
ECP but does show salts pressing against pipe. When running TAC, stacked out
@ 8,165’, assume restriction to be frac balls stacked up in the vertical. Ran 3.70”
mill, but could not drill more than 10° past liner hanger, got sand and ball frac
ball chunks in returns, decided to run rods and pump until after the Magnum #3
and #2 are done being completed. This was done to avoid working while there is a
chance of communication during the fracture stimulation.

Procedure

1.

MIRU WO rig, unseat pump & LD rods. POOH and tally tbg, LD pumping BHA. RU wireline, make 6”
caliper to liner hanger. PU and make 3.70” gauge ring into liner hanger and around curve. Make cleanout run
around curve w/ 2-3/8” tbg and drilling assembly if needed.

PU and wireline set a 4” drillable bridge plug @ 9,350’. Pressure test casing to 2500 psi. RIH and shot sqz
holes @ 7,975’.

Establish circulation down 7” csg and up 7” x 9-5/8” annulus. RIH CICR on 2-7/8” tbg and set @ 7,775’, re-
establish circulation up annulus and pump cement job, attempt to bring cement to surface w/ 30% excess,
hesitate in final 5 bbl of cement, displace to 50’ below CICR.

PU 6” cement drilling BHA and 2-7/8” tbg, DO cement down to LH top, pressure test casing to 1500 psi. Run
CBL to insure good cement. Review CBL results and repeat _sqz procedure to insure cement isolation
over Amsden, Minnekahta, and Dakota formations if needed. Confirm CBL results with NDIC before
proceeding. PU 3.80” drilling BHA, 2-3/8” tbg and drillout out 4-1/2” to third frac sleeve.

POOH and LD 3.80” drilling BHA and 2-3/8” tbg. PU pumping BHA and tbg. PU 1.75” insert pump and

RE: MAGNUM 1-36-25H

WELL FILE NO. 22247

Dear Khem:

After reviewing the Cement Bond Log run on the above referenced well March 22, 2012, it has been
determined remedial cement work will be required. The top of cement behind the 7 inch casing string as
picked from the Cement Bond Log is at a depth of 8587 feet. The North Dakota Administrative Code
Section 43-02-03-21 requires that sufficient cement be used to isolate above the upper most sand within the
Dakota Group.

We are concerned that the PERMIAN-ERODED BROOM CREEK-AMSDEN FM. - 7714’, PERMIAN-
MINNEKAHTA FM. - 7428’, and the CRETACEOUS-NEWCASTLE FM. - 5284’ are not isolated with
cement. SLAWSON EXPLORATION must submit a Form 4 Sundry, detailing SLAWSON
EXPLORATION’s plans for this remedial cement work, and receive NDIC approval. Until a sundry
notice is approved and the remedial work is completed, the stipulations below must be followed:

1. The surface - production casing annulus must be continuously monitored with an accurate
pressure gauge, the pressure gauge must not be any higher than a 300-psi gauge.

2. All valves installed on the annulus must be exposed to the surface; burial will be allowed only in
the presence of an NDIC Oil and Gas Division Inspector.

3. Any pressure development on the annulus must be immediately reported to the Oil and Gas
Division,

If you have any questions, do not hesitate to contact me.

Sincerely,

LLP EE

DETAILS OF WORK
Slawson Exploration Company, Inc. has completed reclamation work on the reserve pit of this well. The surface
owner is Verlin L Fossum, 13922 43RD ST NW, Williston, ND 58801-8709. Any oil in the pit was skimmed off and used
in Invert Mud for drilling other wells. The water was disposed of by Landtech at Slawson's licensed injection facilities
known as the Moen 1-35SWD. Once the fluids were removed the cuttings were dried and mixed with fly ash for
stabilzation. The liner was folded over the stabilized cuttings into the pit and buried approximately 6 ft. deep with
back fill and topsoil. The site will be re-seeded.

DETAILS OF WORK

Slawson Exploration Company, Inc. is panning to begin reclamation work on the reserve pit of this well. The surface
owner is VERLIN L FOSSUM, 13922 43RD ST NW, WILLISTON ND 58801-8709 . Any oil in the pit will be skimmed off
and used in Invert Mud for drilling other wells. The water will be disposed of by Slawson at various licensed Slawson
injection facilities, such as the Sanish 1-9SWD. Once the fluids are removed the cuttings were dried and mixed with
fly ash for stabilzation. The liner will then be folded over the stabilized cuttings in the pit and buried approximately 6
ft. deep with back fill and topsoil. The site will then re-seeded. This construction will be completed by one of the
three following contractors pending availability.

INTRODUCTION

The Slawson Exploration Co. Magnum 1-36-25H [SW SW SEC 36, T153N, R101 W] is located
~15 miles southwest of the town of Williston in McKenzie County, North Dakota. The well was
planned with one 9,183’ long northbound leg with intent to intersect regional fracture trends that

might enhance reservoir quality within the Middle Bakken Member.

Directional tools were utilized to build a curve and land within the 200’ legal setbacks of Section
36. A tangent was drilled prior to casing to cross the western hard line and set in the Middle
Bakken approximately 18’ below the Upper Bakken Shale. 7” intermediate casing was set at this
point to isolate the target reservoir. A single horizontal lateral in the Middle Bakken was

proposed to be drill into the NE % of NW 4 of Section 25.

Lateral drilling fluid was ~10.1— 9.7 ppg diesel invert. Three trips were required while drilling
the Magnum 1-36-25H. The first came as penetration rates began to fall at 16,398’ MD. A fresh
motor and smith bit were put in place to continue the lateral. Approximately 200’ feet later, it
became apparent that the agitator would not allow for data collection with the Sperry MWD tool.

OFFSET INFORMATION

Three previously completed nearby wells were used as offset controls on Magnum 1-36-25H.
The Lindvig 1-35 was drilled in August of 1981 by Texas Gas exploration Co 0.3 miles west of
the Magnum 1-36-25H. The Fossum 15-35H is a parallel Bakken horizontal drilled by SM
Energy Co. in August of 2010 approximately 0.5 miles west of the Magnum 1-36-25H. The
Third offset was the Harper Oil Co.’s Verlin Fossum et al 26-1. It is a vertical Red River well
drilled in December of 1979 1.5 miles northwest of the Magnum 1-36-25H.

During the curve, gamma ray was constantly compared to the offset data to help determine a
proper landing depth. To aid in the landing of the curve, an isopach table (Table 1) was
constructed to measure the distance of select gamma markers to the target depth determined from
the offset wells.

Due to variances in the offset isopachs, a weighted average was used in forecasting a landing
depth. Comparing gamma ray markers at the Magnum 1-36-25H to correlative markers from the
offsets made it easier to predict the probable TVD depth of the Middle Bakken target. With its
proximity, the Lindvig 1-35 most closely resembled gamma ray signatures at the Magnum 1-36-
25H.

VERTICAL OPERATIONS

The Magnum 1-36-25H was spud on January 28, 2012 with a Slawson surface spud rig. A 13 %”
hole was drilled with fresh water to 2,187’ MD and isolated with 9 5/8” 36# J-55 casing
cemented to surface. On February 6, 2012 the Nabors 419 drilling rig reentered surface to begin
vertical operations. Upon casing exit the drilling fluid was changed to diesel invert with a target
weight of 9.9 to 9.7 ppg for use in the remaining vertical and curve. The area surrounding
Magnum was a highly prosperous and well developed Mission Canyon field. As a result,
formational depletion resulted in the loss of 2,363 bbls of invert mud while drilling into the
Mission Canyon. The vertical was drilled to a preliminary KOP of 10,281’ MD with 2 Ulterra
bits. The first drilled from under casing to a MD of 8,502’ where it was pulled as planned for the
Kibbey bit trip. The second Ulterra bit was replaced at 10,281’ MD which was the preliminary
KOP.

The first bit drilled 6,322’ in 66.5 hours for an average ROP of 95.06 ft/hr. The second
completed the vertical after drilling 1,779’ in 32 hours for an average ROP of 55.59 ft/hr.
Vertical operations were completed on February 15, 2012.

DIRECTIONAL OPERATIONS

Sperry Sun provided equipment and personnel for MWD and directional services. Sunburst
Consulting geologists worked closely throughout the project with Sperry Sun to make steering
decisions and maximize the amount of borehole in the pay zone. Attention was also paid to
providing a smooth lateral well bore to ease the implementation of the aggressive production
fracture program. Tight adherence to the drill line was required to prevent any interference with
future drill plans for the section. As such, a window of no more then 25’ on either side of the line
was given. At its widest point the lateral departed the planned line by 20.22’ to the west.

Curve Build

The curve build was to drill down 477’ TVD in 750’ MD and required 12 degrees of build per
100’ (Figures 2 & 3). The curve was drilled with a single 8 3/4 PDC bit. After reaching 90
degrees a tangent section was put in place to cross the western hard line. After completing the
tangent, 7°’ casing was set at 11,529’ MD, 10,808.58’ TVD, ~18’ below the Upper Bakken
Shale. The single Security bit drilled 1,263’ in 86.94 hours for an average drilling rate of 14.52
ft/hr.

The Security FXD55M combined with the Sperry directional motor drilled quickly while
providing predictable and generous build rates. The optimal performance of the curve assembly
allowed for increased rotation whilst decreasing time spent on the build section.

The added benefit of predictable build rates made forecasting the TVD of the False Bakken and
Upper Bakken Shale from penetration rates more reliable; this in turn allowed for on the fly
adjustments to landing target and insured a landing within the desired objective.

O A trip was made to replace the MWD tool and the agitator while leaving the motor and bit.
Both BHA’s were drilled using a flex collar for added stability. The flex monel shown in
diagram below (Figure 4) stabilized rotation and decreased the amount of slides required. This

was the second time a flex collar was used in a Slawson project and it continued to be effective
despite the change in environment.

The first assembly drilled 4,854’ in 99.5 hours for an average ROP of 48.78 ft/hr. The final
assembly, a 5 bladed bit from Smith, drilled 4,332’ in 85.71 hours for and average speed of 50.54
ft/hr. The well reached a total depth (TD) of 20,437’ MD at 20:00 CST March 6. 2012. The use
of a lateral reamer in the drill string helped to reduce hole drag and over pull which will likely
ease the placing of liner.

O GEOLOGIC EVALUATION
Methods

Geologic supervision of Magnum 1-36-25H_was provided by Sunburst Consulting, Inc. with two
well site geologists. A digital gas detector was interfaced with a Pason electronic data recorder
system. Pason provided drill rate, on-off bottom, and pump strokes to the gas detection computer
and received total gas information from Sunburst for viewing around location. Rig crews caught
lagged samples under the direction of Sunburst geologists (see LITHOLOGY for sample lag
intervals and descriptions). The sample cuttings were examined wet and dry under a binocular
microscope using both plain (broad spectrum) and transmitted light. Sunburst personnel also
closely examined MWD gamma ray information and penetration rates to aid in steering decisions
and dip rate estimations.

The Mission Canyon [Mississippian Madison Group] was penetrated at 9,482’ TVD (-7,273’),
|’ high to Lindvig 1-35. Surrounding the Magnum 1-36-25H was a heavily produced Mission
Canyon field. The resulting depletion of formation pressure caused the loss of 2,363 bbls of
invert drilling fluid. On some occasions the formation would give back fluid along with high
sharp increases in hydrocarbon gas. Large amounts of LCM made it difficult to evaluate overall
Mission Canyon potential. The draw down in pressure, however, could speak to favorable
permeability. Samples from the Mission Canyon (Figure 8) were described as:

DOLOMITIC LIMESTONE: mudstone, light brown, very fine crystalline, friable to firm,
microsucrosic texture, trace pyrite, trace to rare intercrystalline porosity, trace light black oil

The Upper Shale of the Bakken Formation [Mississippian — Devonian] was drilled at 10,775’
TVD (-8,566’) suggesting a casing point of 10,811’ TVD. The Bakken came in 8’ low to the
Lindvig 1-35#. Sample returns were typical black, carbonaceous, and petroliferous shale (Figure
10), characterized by gamma ray values in excess of 400 API. Background gas climbed steadily
with peaks above 400 units over a background of about 200 units. Samples were described as:

O The Middle Member of the Bakken Formation was penetrated at 11,975’ MD, (10,791 TVD),
8’ low to the Lindvig 1-35, suggesting a target of 10,811’ TVD (Table 1). While drilling the
Magnum |-36-25H, samples varied only slightly within the target area. Some differences in oil
staining could be seen. The upper half of the targeted interval consisted of a high gamma layer
which primarily consisted of interbedded cream-tan colored silty sandstone with rare to common
oil stain. At times the silty sandstone would be interbedded with light gray siltstone. The lower
edge of zone defined as Marker E was well cemented sandstone with occasional stringers of lime
packstone. Samples collected from the Bakken Formation were described as:

SILTSTONE: medium brown, friable to trace firm, sub blocky to sub platy, calcareous cement,
poorly to trace moderately cemented, trace disseminated pyrite, no visible porosity

SILTY SANDSTONE: cream to off white, very fine grained, friable to trace firm, sub angular to
sub rounded, well sorted, calcareous cement, poorly to trace moderately cemented, trace
disseminated pyrite, possible intergranular porosity, trace dark brown spotty oil stain (Figure 11)

The lateral began with a background gas of about 200 units with an average connection gas
above 300 units. By the time the tangent was drilled and the well bore reached a casing point of
11,544’ MD, background gas had climbed to about 250 units, but connections remained steady.

Shortly after exiting casing, the bit climbed through section along markers C and B (Figure 12).
The average gas climbed slightly to 300 units with connections reaching 400 units (Figure 13). A
peak downtime/connection gas was detected, reaching 900 units. Background levels decreased as

the bit dropped from the top of zone. The bit was allowed to remain within the D marker but
began to drop slightly in section while the laterals turn was being completed. By 12,848’ MD the
bit was hovering just above the E marker in lower D. This proved beneficial as gas levels
increased markedly. Between 12,848’ and 13,340’ MD, background levels climbed as high as
800 units with connections commonly reaching 1,600 units. That interval also enjoyed an
increase in overall ROP that suggests an encouraging porosity.

After 13,350’ MD, background gases dropped dramatically. This was due to the wellbore
passing into marker E. Marker E would prove the most useful marker for steering, however, the
tight sandstone and occasional limestone repeatedly showed a decrease in gas levels. The
background dropped to around 150-250 units until 14,100’ MD.

The next noteworthy total gas increase began at approximately 15,237’ MD. This increase was
noteworthy for two main reasons. The first is that it was the first time an increase in gas was seen
as the bit passed below marker E. The second important note is that the second half of lateral
showed higher average hydrocarbon gas levels. Since Sunburst personnel constantly monitor
equipment for saturation of the sensor filaments, it is possible that a fracture feed began to
increase overall levels.

Gas levels remained steady until passing into marker E at 16,300’ MD. Backgrounds decreased
quickly to below 400 units on average. It would become commonplace to see gas levels waning
as the wellbore intersected Marker E. The Lindvig 1-35 offset shows considerably less porosity
within this interval which is likely to account for reduction in gas levels.

Gas levels drop slightly to an average of 700 units with the majority of connections cresting near
1,000 units. A series of pump related downtimes caused an increase in background gases Starting
just after 19,000’ MD. The downtime allowed gas peaks as high as 1,660 units to be recorded.
As Magnum 1-36-25H approached TD it passed below marker E at 20,033’ MD and the
characteristic drop in gas was observed. Gas levels recovered slightly and ended the lateral with
an average background of 500-600 units.

During the lateral there were two trips to surface for BHA changes. The change outs allowed for
the recording of trip gases of 2,600 and 1,700 units. The gas was punctuated by a 15’-20" flare.
After reaching TD gas was monitored throughout the wiper trip and a peak of over 2,800 units
was observed.

Hydrocarbon Shows by Stratigraphy

The target interval as described by Slawson ranged from marker A to marker F in Figure 12.
Multiple offsets showed that markers A through C had identical signatures. Samples also showed
very little variation throughout the upper half of zone. It was quickly apparent while drilling that
the upper markers would be unreliable for steering since it would be unclear when passing from
one marker to the next.

Marker A: This marker made up the first 2’ of the zone. Overlying marker A was a dark
siltstone with ¢race spotty brown oil stain and low porosity. The wellbore passed through this
zone only one time while drilling the lateral. Observations while drilling this interval discovered
decreased gas levels, increased calcite cementing and an increased content of gray siltstone with
little to no oil staining or no visible porosity. The first time the marker was encountered at
11,432’ MD, gas levels actually decreased to about a third of average background. This is likely
due to a combination of increasing silt content and porosity plugged by increased calcite cement.

Marker B: Marker B began about 2’ into the target zone and continued until 4” into zone. This
facies was encountered early in the tangent section before setting casing. It was similar in nearly
every way to marker C. Common characteristics of this marker were increasing siltstone content
and a slight increase in pyrite levels. [t is important to note that exceptional porosity was
observed in cuttings and offset electric logs showed porosity up to 13% within this interval. It is
unclear how permeable the interval is, but with production fracturing the increased porosity will
likely benefit overall production. Oil staining varied little in the brief encounter with this marker.
In general, trace to rare spotty brown oil stain was seen with areas of little to no oil staining also
observed. On offsets, the gamma reached 90-100 cps, the same as A and C. During lateral
drilling, markers A, B, and C displayed gamma ray measurements between 85-130 cps.

Marker C: Marker C extended from 4’-6’ into the target. This marker showed no characteristics
to set it apart from others and samples were identical to that of marker B. The C marker was able
to be used as a navigational marker as it encompassed the upper hot gamma contact within zone.
At around 14,230’ MD, the marker was observed and accompanied by a respectable increase in
background gas running 100 units higher than lower in formation. The increase in gas could be
attributed to the increased porosity exhibited in offset logs.

steering with the E marker could be problematic when trying to determine if the wellbore passed
below or above the marker as the lateral progressed

Before casing could be set on the Magnum, a 400’ tangent would have to be drilled to cross the
hard-line of section 36. The well bore landed at a casing point of 11,529" MD (10,808.58’ TVD),
approximately 18’ TVD into the Middle Bakken and 7’ below the “MBKMGR” marker (Marker
A). The curve was landed within marker D (Figure 12). Before casing, the large bend motor had
a tendency to build on rotate, making B the first identifiable marker contacted at 11,432’ MD.
Calculated dip showed an aggressive 0.58° down dip. Pushing the bit down allowed the motor to
reenter zone. A small area of very high porosity sandstone was observed around 10,809’ TVD,
with drilling sometimes reaching 180 ft/hr. The ambiguous gamma coupled with the relatively
thin section of high porosity made it impossible to track.

At 13,348’ MD in the lateral, gamma in the range of 75-85 cps and the introduction of packstone
in cuttings indicated that the bit had passed into marker “E”. The Lindvig 1-35 showed that
marker “E” was structurally 11’ from the top of zone. With the marker confirmed, an up dip of
0.20 ° could be calculated. The bit dropped below E until directional slides began to turn the bit
back up to zone. The accent began at ~13,757’ MD and reacquired the E marker at 14,149’ MD.
The reentry suggested that dip had reversed falling to 0.23° down. Again, the cooler gamma was
accompanied by an increase of limestone in samples.

The bit was allowed to climb up in section until the MWD gamma tool indicated that bit was
entering the upper half of zone. As the markers D, C, and B were indistinguishable, the recent
contact with marker E was utilized to determine that the encountered 125-130 cps was indicative
of marker D. The bit leveled off and slowly fell through zone due to an apparent up dip. Samples
within the upper portion of zone showed very little variation with the exception of cementing.
The bit slowly passed below marker E at 14,927’ MD, suggesting that the target top was around
10,978’ TVD. The new data allowed for a dip calculation of 0.29° up.

Despite the expected down dip, formation continued to climb, delaying reentry into zone.
Continued directional corrections allowed the bit to pass into zone at 16,350’ MD, suggesting
that dip had steepened slightly to 0.32° up. It was expected that formation would turn down so
the decision to stay close to marker “E” was made. An occasional tap of marker E would serve
for dip analysis. As the bit climbed through zone no other indicators were seen. After drilling
1,423’, the E marker was seen at 17,680’ MD. Dip had flattened to a slight 0.08° up showing
possible signs that formation may have rolled.

With the possibility of a downturn, the bit angle was kept low in effort to remain agile in the
event that a drop should happen rapidly. The formation indicated that dip was still climbing
when the E marker came up to meet the wellbore at 18,410’ MD. The marker had climbed ~2’ in
730’ showing dip had doubled to 0.16° up. The bit was turned around and was pushed back into
zone at 19,240’ MD, indicating that formation was still building despite suggested structural
models.

The bit was allowed to drill along marker D and was encouraged to climb in order to obtain some
markers that may be useful for regional mapping. The bit eventually became strata bound

Marker D: Marker D had very distinct drilling characteristics. The D marker began about 8’
from the top of zone and in the lateral averaged a 95-100 cps gamma signature. The first and
most notable change in drilling was seen at a TVD of 10,809’. A portion of the D marker would
drill as fast as 200 ft/hr, suggesting favorable porosity conditions; however, the interval was
small and difficult to track. When the bit entered this “high speed zone” the bit would multiply
the angle at which it entered. This caused the bit to pass quickly through the interval despite the
angle at which it was encountered. The D marker also had areas of ratty drilling that would cause
deflections down. Due primarily to uniform gamma that was seen in the 4’ segment that formed
marker D, the exact stratigraphic position where these deviations occurred could not be
determined. The majority of the lateral was drilled within this marker and most of the increases
in background gas can be seen while drilling this interval. The highest average background gas
starting around 18,000’ MD was drilled within this interval.

Marker E: Marker E ranged from 12’-13’ TVD below the top of zone. This interval showed the
most variety in sample. At times trace amounts of lime packstone would be observed as well as
increased contents of sparry calcite and calcareous cement. In general trace to rare spotty brown
oil staining was noted. Levels of hydrocarbon gas decreased when the well bore passed through
this interval. The drop in gas does coincide with a drop in porosity seen in samples and offset
porosity logs.

Marker F: Was found just below zone and shared sample characteristics of marker D. The two
zones were identical except for a subtle difference in benchmark gamma. The D marker averaged
between 95 and 100 gamma while the F marker ranged from 98 to 105 cps. The distinction of
this slight difference was crucial to follow formation and maximizing zone exposure. Like
marker C, the silty sandstone of marker F showed trace to spotty oil stain.

Geo-Steering

The target zone within the Middle Bakken is defined as the 14’ zone below gamma marker
“MBKMGR” (Marker A). Slawson feels that optimal hydrocarbon production can be achieved
with the implementation of an aggressive production frac program regardless of position within
the Middle Bakken. The target zone in the Middle Bakken was established based on the samples
and electric logs from nearby offset wells. Prognosis predicted 35’ of viable zone between the
Bakken shales, the first 9’ of which is above the desired target. The Magnum 1-36-25H required
a lateral turn to due north which resulted in the implementation of slides purely for azimuth.

The initial prognosis called for a regional dip of roughly 0.12° down causing the pay zone to
drop ~20’ over the course of the two section lateral. Despite structural modeling, the majority of
Magnum 1-36-25’ s lateral was up dip. SM previously drilled a parallel lateral that suggested a
near flat formation after an initial climb. Gamma markers from a large collection of offset data
showed little to no definition within the targeted interval. An example can be seen in Figure 12
where over half of the target interval is shown to average between 90-100 cps. As the lateral
progressed, the “E” marker became the most recognizable and efforts were made to stay
structurally near the cool gamma segment to help analyze dip changes with the formation. This
practice led to the majority of dip calculations being made from the “E” marker. However,

@ between two thinly separated hard layers that caused large changes in inclination and azimuth.
An effort to regain stability was made and the bit was pushed down. It is believed that down
sliding was accented by both a bounce from the upper layer and angle exaggeration from passing
through the lower layer. The effects caused the bit to dive steeply to where a survey revealed a
lateral low angle of 87.53° at 19,957’ MD. The resulting drop caused the wellbore to pass
through marker E for the last time at 20,033’ MD (Figure 15). A final dip calculation of 0.20° up
was made and projected 700’ to TD. The bit was allowed to rotate as the lateral drew to an end
and it began to stabilize with the final survey being above 90°.

The well ended with the bit about 27’ below the Upper Bakken Shale at 20,730’ MD. The final
bottom hole location of Magnum 1-36-25H is 10,035.41’ North & 524.39’ East of surface
location or approximately 248.05’ FNL & 1,339.39' FWL NE NW Sec. 25 TI53N, RIOLW

Conclusions

The Magnum 1-36-25H shows moderate potential for hydrocarbon production. The intervals
marked as A, B, and C are recorded to have as much as 13% porosity on offsets. The Slawson
fracture program will likely maximize the local porosity matrix and allow for increased
production value. Porosity in some cuttings showed calcite occlusion, the levels of which may
impact permeability.

® SUMMARY

1) The Magnum 1-36-25H was spud on January 28, 2012 with a Slawson surface spud rig.
Nabors 419 drilling rig was accepted on site on February 6, 2012. Vertical operations
were completed on February 15, 2012 after being delayed by an under-pressured Mission
Canyon.

2) Localized depletion of the Mission Canyon made vertical operations difficult; however,
quick and effective use of LCM was eventually successful in stopping the rapid loss of
drilling fluid.

3) Asingle Security bit drilled a 1,263’ MD curve in 86.94 hours for an average drilling rate
of 14.52 ft/hr. The overall average was decreased do to the long tangent drill that was
required to cross the western hard line.

4) Lateral hole drag was reduced with the use of an inline reamer. The ease at which the bit
was able to reach bottom while sliding should indicate a nicely groomed wellbore for
liner insertion.

5) The Slawson Exploration Co. Magnum _1-36-25H_ awaits completion operations to
determine its ultimate production potential. 4” production liner will be set to bottom to
facilitate an aggressive fracture stimulation program.

LITHOLOGY

Rig crews caught samples in 30’ intervals from 7,670’ — 11,510’ and 50’ samples from 11,500’—
20,730’ (TD). Gamma ray marker tops have been inserted into the sample descriptions below for
reference. Samples were examined wet and dry under a binocular microscope. Sample
descriptions begin just above the Tyler. The drilling fluid was diesel invert mud from surface
casing exit to 20,730’ (TD).

Slawson Exploration Company, Inc. (SEC!) respectfully requests an open hole logging waiver for the Magnum
#1-36-25H well. It Is located less than one mile from the Lindvig 1-35 well (8882), which was drilled by Texas Gas
Exploration Corp. and logs were completed. Geologic control for the Magnum #1-36-25H will be achieved utilizing
mudiogs and the gamma ray log from the MWD tool to be run In this well. A CBL/GR log will also be run from the
KOP to 100° above TOC and to the surface with the GR.

RE: HORIZONTAL WELL
MAGNUM 1-36-25H
SWSW Section 36-153N-101W
McKenzie County
Well File # 22247

Dear Khem :

Pursuant to Commission Order No. 18012, approval to drill the above captioned well is hereby given. The
approval is granted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than
the 200' setback from the north & south boundaries and 1220' setback (per Commission policy) from the east
& west boundaries within the 1280 acre spacing unit consisting of All of Sections 25 & 36 T153N R101W.

PERMIT STIPULATIONS: LOCATION PERIMETER DIKE REQUIRED. ALSO, IN ORDER TO
JUSTIFY THE SPACING UNIT, THE MAGNUM 1-36-25H & MAGNUM 2-36-25H MUST BE
DRILLED BACK TO BACK. ALTERNATIVELY, SLAWSON MUST DRILL THE MAGNUM 1-36-
25H IF ONLY ONE WELL IS DRILLED IN THE SPACING UNIT INITIALLY. LASTLY,
SLAWSON MUST CONTACT MARK BINNS AT’ 701-220-5989 PRIOR TO LOCATION
CONSTRUCTION.

Form 1 Changes & Hard Lines

Any changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC.
The proposed directional plan is at a legal location. The minimum legal coordinate from the well head at casing
point is: 405E. Also, based on the azimuth of the proposed lateral the maximum legal coordinate from the well
head is: 10083N & 405E.

Location Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period)

Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the
approved drilling permit on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report. If circumstances require operations to
commence before the 3rd business day following publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may
be waived by the Director. Application for a waiver must be by sworn affidavit providing the information
necessary to evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f), and any other
information that would allow the Director to conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the
drilling permit, the applicant should retain the permit.

Permit Fee & Notification

Payment was received in the amount of $100 via credit card. It is requested that notification be given
immediately upon the spudding of the well. This information should be relayed to the Oil & Gas Division,
Bismarck, via telephone. The following information must be included: Well name, legal location, permit number,
drilling contractor, company representative, date and time of spudding. Office hours are 8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m.

Survey Requirements for Horizontal, Horizontal Re-entry, and Directional Wells
NDAC Section 43-02-03-25 (Deviation Tests and Directional Surveys) states in part (that) the survey
contractor shall file a certified copy of all surveys with the director free of charge within thirty days of completion.
Surveys must be submitted as one electronic copy, or in a form approved by the director. However, the director
may require the directional survey to be filed immediately after completion if the survey is needed to conduct the
operation of the director's office in a timely manner. Certified surveys must be submitted via email in one adobe
document, with a certification cover page to certsurvey@nd.gov.

Survey points shall be of such frequency to accurately determine the entire location of the well bore.

Confidential status

Your request for confidential status of all information furnished to the Director, or his representatives, is
hereby granted. Such information, except production runs, shall remain confidential for six months commencing
on the date the well is spud.

Confidential status notwithstanding, the Director and his representatives shall have access to all well
records wherever located. Your company personnel, or any person performing work for your company shall
permit the Director and his representatives to come upon any lease, property, well, or drilling rig operated or
controlled by them, complying with all safety rules, and to inspect the records and operation of such wells and to
have access at all times to any and all records of wells. The Commission's field personnel periodically inspect
producing and drilling wells. Any information regarding such wells shall be made available to them at any time
upon request. The information so obtained by the field personnel shall be maintained in strict confidence and
shall be available only to the Commission and its staff.

Drilling pit
Please be advised approval for use of a drilling reserve pit or drill cuttings pit on this site is contingent on
site specific conditions and special pit closure requirements may apply.

Surface casing cement

Tail cement utilized on surface casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi within 12
hours, and tail cement utilized on production casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi
before drilling the plug or initiating tests.

Logs

NDAC Section 43-02-03-31 requires the running of a Cement Bond Log from which the presence of
cement can be determined in every well in which production or intermediate casing has been set and a Gamma
Ray Log must be run from total depth to ground level elevation of the well bore. All logs must be submitted as
one paper copy and one digital copy in LAS (Log ASCII) format, or a format approved by the Director. Image
logs that include, but are not limited to, Mud Logs, Cement Bond Logs, and Cyberlook Logs, cannot be produced
in their entirety as LAS (Log ASCI)) files. To create a solution and establish a standard format for industry to
follow when submitting image logs, the Director has given approval for the operator to submit an image log as a
TIFF (*.tif) formatted file. The TIFF (*.tif) format will be accepted only when the log cannot be produced in its
entirety as a LAS (Log ASCII) file format. The digital copy may be submitted on a standard CD, or attached to an
email sent to digitallogs@nd.gov Thank you for your cooperation.

Sincerely,

Todd L. Holweger
