Synopsis

Oasis Petroleum Kline Federal 5300 41-18 10B [SW SW Sec. 18 T153N R100W] is located ~6
miles Northwest of the town of Williston, North Dakota. Kline Federal 5300 41-18 10B is
situated within the Baker Field. A single lateral leg trending 90° was proposed to be drilled from
the SW SW corner of Section 18 to the SE SE corner of Section 17 targeting the porous
sandstone and silty sandstone of the Middle Bakken.

Control Wells

Two completed wells were used as the control offsets to the Kline Federal 5300 41-18 1OB.

The primary offset considered was the Kline Federal 5300 41-18 11T2 [SW SW Sec. 18 T153N,
R100W] which is a horizontal well drilled by Oasis Petroleum. Kline Federal 5300 41-18 11T2
is located approximately 33 feet south of Kline Federal 5300 41-18 10B.

The other offset considered was the Kline Federal 5300 41-18 12TX [SW SW Sec. 18 T153N,
R100W] which is a horizontal well drilled by Oasis Petroleum. Kline Federal 5300 41-18 12TX
is located approximately 66 feet south of Kline Federal 5300 41-18 10B.

During the curve, the gamma ray that was produced was constantly compared to the Kline
Federal 5300 41-18 11T2 and the Kline Federal 5300 41-18 12TX wells. Gamma ray was used
to help determine a proper landing depth.

To assist in the choosing of the landing target, an isopach table (Table 1) was constructed to
measure the distance of formation tops to the target depth determined from the Kline Federal
5300 41-18 11T2 and Kline Federal 5300 41-18 12TX offset wells. Comparison of gamma ray
markers showed the most consistent isopach for up-hole formations to be the False Bakken.

Geologic Assessment

Methods

Geologic supervision of Kline Federal 5300 41-18 10B was provided by experienced RPM well
site geologists. Gas and chromatograph levels were measured using NOV WellSight Gas
Detection real time gas detector and chromatograph system. The WellSight gas detection system
uses non-dispersive infrared and chemical sensor gas detection to evaluate gases liberated from
the formation by the drill bit and carried to the surface by the drilling fluid.

The gas detector was interfaced with a Rig Watch electronic data recorder system. RigWatch
provided drill rate, on-off bottom and pump strokes to the gas detector and received total gas
information from the gas detector for viewing on location and remotely.

Under the direction of RPM well site geologists, rig crews were instructed to catch lagged drill
cutting samples at 30’ intervals in the vertical hole and curve build from 8,350’ to 11,175’ MD
and 50’ samples from 11,175’ to TD (20,475’).

Sampled drill cuttings were examined wet and dry under a binocular microscope using both plain
(broad spectrum) and transmitted light. Cuttings were evaluated for hydrocarbon “cut” by
immersion in Acetone and inspection under a UV fluoroscope. 10% hydrochloric acid and
alizarin red were used to determine the calcareous and dolomitic content of rocks and cementing.

RPM Geologic, Inc. (RPM) well site geologists also closely examined MWD gamma-ray
information and penetration rates to aid in steering decisions and dip degree estimations.

Vertical Operations

Overview

The Kline Federal 5300 41-18 10B was spud for surface drilling on 9 September 2014 utilizing
Nabors 486 as the drilling contractor. Prior to commencement of RPM mud logging services, a
17 1/2” hole was drilled with fresh water to depth of 2,125’ and isolated with 13 3/8” 54# J-55
casing cemented from 2,083' to surface. To ensure hole stability a 12 '4” hole was drilled to a
depth of 6,140’ and 40# 8 5/8 casing was set at 6,125’.

RPM well site geologists began logging the vertical interval at 8,350’.

Two PDC bit were used to drill out of secondary casing casing to vertical TD. PDC bit #1 (8 4”
Varel) was used to drill from 2,140’ to 9,9500’ and averaged an ROP of 62 ft/hr in 61.5 hours of
use. A second Varel PDC bit was used to continue drilling to a vertical TD of 10,240’ MD in 4.5
hours with an average penetration rate of 64.4 ft/hr

The top of the Mission Canyon formation of the Madison Group [Mississippian] was reached at
9,428’ (-7,346’), 2’ high to the Kline Federal 5300 41-18 11T2. Samples from this interval
(Figure 3) were described as:

LIMESTONE: wackestone, light gray to medium gray, light gray brown to medium
gray brown, occasional off white friable to firm, crystalline to microcrystalline

Directional Operations

Gyrodata provided equipment and personnel for MWD teams, while RPM Consulting provided
directional personnel. RPM geologists worked closely with RPM directional as well as Gyrodata
MWD teams to formulate steering decisions to maximize the footage of borehole in the pay
zone.

Curve Build

Overview

Two PDC bits were used to build the curve section. Bit #3 was an 8 *%4” Security bit used to drill
the curve from a measured depth of 10,240’ to 10,859’ in 17.5 hours, averaging 34.50 ft/hr. Bit
#4 (8 34” Security) was used to drill the curve from a measured depth of 10,859’ to 11,175’ in

Gas and hydrocarbon Shows

It was found that the gas and hydrocarbon shows were elevated through the entire lateral with an
average background gas of ~3500 units and common peaks of between 7000u and 8000u.

The NOV gas chromatograph showed components of all C1-C4 present through the entire lateral.
Sample cuttings throughout the lateral showed oil stain and a fast white diffuse cut when
submerged in Acetone solution and observed with a UV fluoroscope. Trace oil was observed in
the sample wash water.

10.5 hours, averaging 30.1 ft/hr. 7” 32# P-110 casing was set to 11,037’ MD upon completion of
the curve.

A Chart was constructed for the curve (Chart 1) that compared the isopach of certain easily
recognizable gamma markers from the Kibbey Lime to Middle Bakken on the control well
Kline Federal 5300 41-18 11T2 and Kline Federal 5300 41-18 12TX to the Kline Federal 5300
41-18 10B as marker picks were made. This chart shows the False Bakken top being very close
in thickness to target based on the offset wells, and was the main point used to make changes to
the target landing depth during the curve. The curve was completed at a measured depth of
11,175’and TVD of 10,752’, ~19 feet below the base of the Upper Bakken Shale.

Lateral

Overview

Drilling fluid consisting of open system salt water brine (9.6-9.7 ppg) was used while drilling the
lateral section up to the TD of 20,475’. Four 6” PDC bits were used to drill the lateral.

Bit #5 (Varel VM613P2) was a PDC bit used to drill the start of the lateral from 11,175’ to
13,813’ and averaged an ROP of 57.30 over 46 hours of use. Bit #6 (Reed) was a PDC bit used
to drill from 13,813’ to 16,761’; it was used for 69 hours at an average drilling rate of 42.70 feet
per hour. Bit #7 (Smith MDSi613) was a PDC bit used to drill from 16,761’ to 19,731’, and was
used for 91 hours and averaged an ROP of 42.70 ft/hr. Bit #8 (Smith MDSi613) was a PDC bit
used to drill from 19,731’ to TD @ 20,475’

The Upper Bakken Shale was encountered at the measured depth 15,220’. The decision was
made to move the bit back to 15,070’ MD and sidetrack. Time drilling began using the 5-5 4-4
3-3 2-2 1-1 method and once that was concluded at 15,102’ MD the sidetrack was drilled to
forward.

The Lower Bakken Shale was encountered at the measured depth 18,550’. The decision was
made to move the bit back to 18,000’ MD and sidetrack. Time drilling began using the 5-5 4-4
3-3 2-2 1-1 method and once that was concluded at 18,021’ MD the sidetrack was drilled to TD.

Drilling operations were concluded at 10:48 on December 31, 2014 at a bottom hole location of
10,630.79' S & 1,109.25' E of surface location or approximately 754.45' FSL & 283.76' FEL of
SE SE Sec. 22 T153N, R100W.

Lithology

The target Zone of the Middle Bakken consisted of a zone 9 to 19 feet below the Upper
Bakken Shale. This zone consists of a silty sandstone with very intergranular porosity,
moderate gas, and visible oil stain (Figure 6). Samples from the target Zone were generally
described as:

SILTY SANDSTONE: light to medium gray, common light brown to tan, common
white to off white, very fine grained, friable to firm, moderately to well sorted, sub
rounded to sub angular, moderately to poorly cemented, visible calcareous fluid
fractures, trace disseminated pyrite, possible fracture porosity, common intergranular
porosity, trace light brown spotty oil stain

The Kline Federal 5300 41-18 10B was initially spud for surface drilling on September
9th 2014 in the Indian Hill field of McKenzie County, North Dakota. The well was spud
by Nabors 486 and the vertical hole was drilled to a total depth (KOP) of 10,240’.

A mud program consisted of diesel invert (9.8-9.9 ppg) after surface casing through the
curve build sections. The drilling mud was successful in maintaining stable hole
conditions and minimizing washout through the salt intervals. Brine water with a weight
of 9.6-9.7 ppg was used during lateral drilling operations to maintain hydrostatic balance
until a TD of 20,475’.

Two 8 %4” Varel PDC bit was used to drill out of surface casing to a KOP of 10,240’.
Two 8 *%4” PDC bits were used to drill the curve to 11,175’ MD. Four 6” PDC bits were
used to drill the lateral to 20,475’ TD.

The lateral was targeting the Middle Member of the Bakken Formation member
ranging from about 9’ and 19’ below the base of the Upper Bakken Shale

Gas levels between 3000 and 4000 units were maintained with peaks over 8000 units
through the lateral drilling operations while in the Middle Member.

The Middle Member of the Bakken Formation target consisted of one observed gross
lithology. The Middle Member was observed to be a silty sandstone with lots of
disseminated pyrite and apparent intergranular porosity with visible oil stain.

Trace to moderate oil stain was observed in zone associated with a fast, white, diffuse
cut. Trace oil washed out of the samples into the wash water when they were cleaned.

Drilling operations were concluded at 14:00 on July 8", 2014 at a bottom hole location of
254.45' south & 9968.39' east of surface location or approximately 754.45' FSL &
283.76' FEL of SE SE Sec. 22, T153N-R100W.

Oasis Petroleum’s Kline Federal 5300 41-18 1OB awaits completion operations to
determine its ultimate production potential.

Kline Federal 5800 41-18 10B LITHOLOGY

Geologists caught lagged samples in 30’ intervals in the vertical hole, from 8,350’ to 10,240’ MD; 30’
intervals in the curve build from 10,860’ to 11,175’ MD; and 50’ samples in the lateral from 11,175’ to
TD at 20,475’

Electric geophysical log, sample and/or MWD gamma ray markers and tops are included in the sample
descriptions below for reference. Samples were examined wet and dry under a binocular microscope in
approximately 30’ to 50’ intervals. Sample descriptions begin in the Kibbey Formation. The drilling
fluid was diesel invert in the vertical and curve, and salt water brine in the lateral.

1. the well is equipped with new 29# and 32# casing at surface with an API burst rating of 11,220 psi;

2. The Frac design will ise a safety factor of 0.85 API burst rating to determine the maximum pressure;

3. Liamage to the casing during the frac would be detected immediately by montioring equipement;

4. The casing is exposed to significantly lower rates and pressures during flowback than during the frac job;
5. The frac fluid and formation fluids have very low corrosion and erosion rates;

6. F'roduction equipment will be installed as soon as possible after the well ceases flowing;
7. A 300# gauge will be installed on the surface casing during the flowback period

Well File # 28652
Dear Heather:

Pursuant to Commission Order No. 23752, approval to drill the above captioned well is hereby given. The
approval is granted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than
the 500' setback from the north & south boundaries and 200' setback from the east & west boundaries within the
1280 acre spacing unit consisting of Sections 18 & 17 T153N R100W.

PERMIT STIPULATIONS: Due to the proximity of Lake Sakakawea to the well site, a dike is required
surrounding the entire location. Effective June 1, 2014, a covered leak-proof container (with placard) for
filter sock disposal must be maintained on the well site beginning when the well is spud, and must
remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations are
conducted. OASIS PETRO NO AMER must contact NDIC Field Inspector Richard Dunn at 701-770-
3554 prior to location construction.

Drilling pit

NDAC 43-02-03-19.4 states that “a pit may be utilized to bury drill cuttings and solids generated during well
drilling and completion operations, providing the pit can be constructed, used and reclaimed in a manner that will
prevent pollution of the land surface and freshwaters. Reserve and circulation of mud system through earthen pits
are prohibited. All pits shall be inspected by an authorized representative of the director prior to lining and use.
Drill cuttings and solids must be stabilized in a manner approved by the director prior to placement in a cuttings

pit.”

Form 1 Changes & Hard Lines

Any changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC.
The proposed directional plan is at a legal location. Based on the azimuth of the proposed lateral the maximum
legal coordinate from the well head is: 10052’ east.

Location Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period)

Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the
approved drilling permit on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report. If circumstances require operations to
commence before the 3rd business day following publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may
be waived by the Director. Application for a waiver must be by sworn affidavit providing the information
necessary to evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f, and any other
information that would allow the Director to conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the
drilling permit, the applicant should retain the permit.

DETAILS OF WORK

Oasis Petroleum North America LLC requests permission for suspension of drilling for up to 90 days for the
referenced well under NDAC 43-02-03-55, Oasis Petroleum North America LLC intends to drill the surface hole with
freshwater based drilling mud and set surface casing with a small drilling rig and move off within 3 to 5 days. The
casing will be set at a depth pre-approved by the NDIC per the Application for Permit to Drill NDAC 43-02-03-21. No
saltwater will be used in the drilling and cementing operations of the surface casing. Once the surface casing is
cemented, a plug or mechanical seal will be placed at the top of the casing to prevent any foreign matter from getting
into the well. A rig capable of drilling to TD will move onto the location within the 90 days previously outlined to
complete the drilling and casing plan as per the APD. The undersigned states that this request for suspension of
drilling operations in accordance with the Subsection 4 of Section 43-02-03-55 of the NDAC, is being requested to
take advantage of the cost savings and time savings of using an initial rig that is smaller than the rig necessary to
drill a well to total depth but is not intended to alter or extend the terms and conditions of, or suspend any obligation
under, any oil and gas lease with acreage in or under the spacing or drilling unit for the above-referenced well. Oasis
Petroleum North America LLC understands NDAC 43-02-03-31 requirements regarding confidentiality pertaining to
this permit. The drilling pit will be fenced immediately after construction if the well pad is located in a pasture (NDAC
43-02-03-19 & 19.1). Oasis Petroleum North America LL will plug and abandon the well and reclaim the well site if the
well is not drilled by the larger rotary rig within 90 days after spudding the well with the smaller drilling rig.

RE: Filter Socks and Other Filter Media
Leakproof Container Required
Oil and Gas Wells

Dear Operator,

North Dakota Administrative Code Section 43-02-03-19.2 states in part that all waste material associated with
exploration or production of oil and gas must be properly disposed of in an authorized facility in accord with all
applicable local, state, and federal laws and regulations.

Filtration systems are commonly used during oil and gas operations in North Dakota. The Commission is very
concerned about the proper disposal of used filters (including filter socks) used by the oil and gas industry.

Effective June 1, 2014, a container must be maintained on each well drilled in North Dakota beginning when the
well is spud and must remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations
are conducted. The on-site container must be used to store filters until they can be properly disposed of in an
authorized facility. Such containers must be:

e leakproof to prevent any fluids from escaping the container

e covered to prevent precipitation from entering the container

e placard to indicate only filters are to be placed in the container

If the operator will not utilize a filtration system, a waiver to the container requirement will be considered, but
only upon the operator submitting a Sundry Notice (Form 4) justifying their request.

As previously stated in our March 13, 2014 letter, North Dakota Administrative Code Section 33-20-02.1-01
states in part that every person who transports solid waste (which includes oil and gas exploration and production
wastes) is required to have a valid permit issued by the North Dakota Department of Health, Division of Waste
Management. Please contact the Division of Waste Management at (701) 328-5166 with any questions on the
solid waste program. Note oil and gas exploration and production wastes include produced water, drilling mud,
invert mud, tank bottom sediment, pipe scale, filters, and fly ash.

Thank you for your cooperation.

Sincerely,

Brace E. Fichs
