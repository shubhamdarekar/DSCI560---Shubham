Our conversation on May 2, 2014 discussed flood preparations for wells that your company operates
near Williston, North Dakota. The Missouri River continues to rise and the possibility of additional
flooding from the spring melt and recent rains in the near future exists. | urge you to closely monitor
these sites and take the necessary preventative actions to eliminate or mitigate environmental damage
if these sites become deluged with flood waters. The following e-mail from Allen Schlag of the National
Weather Service also addresses the current situation of the Missouri River in the Williston area:

Subject: Missouri River

Greetings everyone

Just a quick note on the Missouri River near Williston forecast site and the prospects for problems as
we go forward into latter half of May and early June (by default this also includes the Yellowstone in
ND as well). As you may have noticed already, the Missouri River near Williston crossed over into
Forecast Issuance Stage this past weekend before falling back below 20 ft. This, is temporary. While
the Corps released a statement last week tempering their runoff expectations for the Missouri River
overall, the attached graphic of mountain snowpack suggests we still have a pretty strong runoff into
the Yellowstone and Missouri Rivers ahead of us.

We will most likely cross over above flood stage as measured at the Lewis and Clark Bridge west of
Williston at some point in the next couple of weeks.

What exactly lies in store for the area with respect to eventual river stages is still quite unclear as the
overall environment for the melt of the mountain snowpack is too far out. However...there has been
a fairly wet pattern in the plains of Montana already this spring, with a mixed bag in the upper
elevations of central MT. The region remains well above normal with respect to mountain snowpack,
but is also well below where 1997 and 2011 were at this point in time (see the second attached pdf).

If | had to take a wild guess this far in advance, something around the 22.5 to 24.5 ft range is
reasonable, with any added big rains this could be expanded quite easily to the 25-26 ft range.

How exactly this will compare to this spring's ice jams and high water is a really good question, which |
don't have any easy answers to either. Suffice to say, | think there's a pretty decent chance that we
will see water roughly 4-6 ft higher than is currently in northwestern ND along both the Yellowstone
and Missouri Rivers with the timing of near the last week of May to about the third week of June.
Historically, | know there have been some access issues with oil well sites in the Trenton area with
water levels in the 22 ft range at the Lewis and Clark Bridge. How much of this has been mitigated by
ring dikes or road raises, again...very good question to which | have no answer.

Of course, if you have any questions or just want to chat about this in greater detail, always feel free
to give me a call.

Allen

RE: Oil and Gas Production Sites

Dear Mr. Mungas:

As we are heading into spring, it 1s a good time to make improvements on oil and gas production
sites and ensure compliance with the Rules and Regulations of the North Dakota Administrative
Code. Things that I am curently checking are dead vegetation, dikes, and oil and/or salt
saturated soil. These Code requirements are listed below for your reference. As a result of
recent inspections, ] have noted items on the attached sheet, which require attention.

43-02-03-28 (Safety Regulation) “All vegetation must be removed to a safe distance
from any production equipment to eliminate a fire hazard.”

43-02-03-49 (Oil Spills, Production Equipment, Dikes and Seals), “Dikes must be
constructed of sufficiently impermeable material to provide emergency containment
and of sufficient dimension to contain the total capacity of the largest tank plus one
day’s fluid production.”

“At uo time shall oil be allowed to flow over or pool on the surface of the land or
iufiltrate the soil.”

Please make certain all of your other sites are also in compliance. If there are any questions,
please feel free to contact the Williston office at (701) 774-4380.

Sincerely,

Field Inspector

Dear Ms. Vogl:

Nance Petroleum Corporation (Nance) filed with the North Dakota Industrial Commission — Oil

Determination for the above captioned well.

Information contained in the application indicates that the above mentioned well is a property
pursuant to statute and rule, and Nancc has eleeted to designate said well as a separate property
for stripper well purposes. The well produced from a well depth greater than 10000 feet. During
the qualifying period, January 1, 2006 through Deeember 31, 2006 the well produeed at a
maximum efficient rate and the average daily production from the well was 29.9 barrels of oil
pet day during this period.

It is therefore determined that the above eaptioned well qualifies as a “Stripper Well Property”
pursuant to Section 57-51.1-0! of the North Dakola Century Code. This determination is
applicable only to the Madison Pool in and under said property.

The Commission shall have continuing jurisdiction, and shall have the authonty to review the
matter, and to amend or rescind the determination if such aetion is supported by additional or
newly discovered information. If you have any questions, do not hesitate to contact me.

Sincerely,

Schematic on a map showing the location and route of the pipelines:
SO eo
See uttached Site Diagram, indicating the location of the pipelines. At this saa ae
facility, the “pipelines” are buried flowlines which connect the wellhead to the
production facilities (heater treater and storage tanks). All flowlines are located within
the boundaries of the well pad. The entire well pad is surrounded by a large dike, and the
treater and storage tanks are surrounded by their own dike (see “Dikes and their

capacities”).
Pipeline Information:

Flow line - (Buried) 3” steel welded fusion bond coated (Schedule 80)
WP — 5,520 psi

Oil Fill line — (Buried) 3” SDR 11 poly
WP — 160 psi

Salt water fill line- (Buried) 3” SDR 11 poly

Recyele line — (Buried) 3” SDR !1 poly
WP - 160 psi

Age: 3 years (completed 6/6/03)
Monitoring Systems installed: None
Surveillance Programs in place: None
Inspection and Maintenance Programs in place:

This is a single wellsite facility. Oil and produced water flow {ram the well, into and out
of pressure vessels and to bulk storage by interconnecting piping. The piping may be
either above or below ground, but does not extend past the outer boundaries of the
wellsite. Production operations personnel perform routine operational (visual)
examinations on above ground interconnecting piping for indication of leaks.
abnormalities, or equipment malfunctions during their daily visit to the facility. Below
ground flowlines are walked and a visual examination is performed for indications ofa
leak if a production shortage shows the need. Records of daily checks arc recorded on
gauge sheets. Periodic, comprehensive flowline inspections are performed by Nance
Petroieum personnel and recorded on a well inspection report. These records are
maintained at the Nance Petroleum Williston, ND and Billings, MT offices.

Describe Cause of Release or Fire
Oil storage tank overflow. Pumper had been gauging wrong storage tank causing actual storage tank that was
receiving oil to overflow. Spill was contained within tank dike.

Action Taken to Control Release and Clean up Action Undertaken
Switched valves to stop tank from overflowing. Cleaned up tank exterior and affected area with steam truck and
sucked up with vac truck on January 13, 2004. Used 30 bbls FW for cleanup. Recovered total of 40 bbls liquid
(including appx. 4 bbls of snowmelt which is listed as “other recovered").

Potential Environmental Impacts

Negligible oil stain on ground inside tank dike.

Planned Future Action and/or Action Taken to Prevent Reoccurrence
Pumper will pay closer attention to valves at the tank battery.

Where Were Recovered Liquids Dispased Where Were Recovered Solids Disposed

LandTech Disposal. No solids recovered.

Well File #15358
Dear Mr. Evettz:

Pursuant to Commission Order No. 9468, approval to deviate the well bore of the above
captioned well is hereby given.

The approval is granted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by
cement, be no closer than 500 fect from the spacing unit consisting of the N2 of Sec. 3 and the N2
of Sec. 4-153N-101W. Inaccuracy of the survey equipment must be considered when determining
compliance with setbacks.

A directional survey of the well showing the location of the well bore shall be filed with the
Industrial Commission within 30 days after completion of the well. Such survey must be certified by
a representative of the survey contractor and mailed directly to us by the contractor. Survey points
shall be of such frequency to accurately determine the entire location of the well bore.

Sincerely,

NDIC:

After our submission of the Form 6 Completion Report on the above referenced :

well, it was determined that we had erroneously reported the footage |

measurements of the lateral legs at TD. The attached Form 6 shows the corrected

footages. The original Form 6 reports should be replaced with the enclosed
corrected reports.

Sorry for the confusion. Please let me know if you have any questions.

EVALUATION

GENERAL

The Nance Petroleum Corporation Lewis & Clark #2-4H was designed as a
horizontal outpost development weil for the Nesson member of the Mississippian
Mission Canyon Formation within the Baker Field. The Baker Field is located in the
U.S. portion of the Williston Basin, in McKenzie County, North Dakota. Due to its
location on the Missouri River floodplain, a gravel pad was built up above the
surrounding ground elevation for the drilling of the Lewis & Clark #2-4H and any
subsequent wells drilled from this location. The planned bottom hole location for the
initia! lateral in the Lewis & Clark #2-4 was north and west of the surface location. Later
sidetracks may be added with different orientations.

The primary offset wells used for correlation while drilling the Lewis & Clark #2-
4H were :

1) the Basic Earth Science Systems, Inc. Basic Game & Fish #34-3 (now
owned by Nance Petroleum Corp.), with the surface location 392’ FSL
& 494’ FWL in the SW SW Section 2, T153N, R101W, McKenzie Co.,

O N.D. The Basic Game & Fish was drilled directionally in late 1985 from

a pad in the SW SW Section 2 to a bottom hole location in the SE SE
Section 3. Completed in the Nesson zone of the Mission Canyon
Formation, the original well produced 224,525 BO, 107,142 MCFG,
and 6,623’ BW through mid 2002. Nance re-entered the Basic Game
& Fish in November of 2003 and drilled a 3,800’ horizontal leg in the
Nesson. The bottom hole location of the horizontal leg was in the NE
SW Section 3, 1,975’ North and 4,338.8’ West of the surface location.
Recent production from the Nesson lateral has averaged 220 BOPD.

the John L. Cox French-Pinney #24-3 (now owned by Nance
Petroleum Corp.), located 660’ FSL & 1,955’ FWL in the SE SW
Section 3, T153N, R101W, McKenzie Co.,N.D. The French-Pinney
was drilled in 1987 and completed in the Red River Formation
(Ordovician in age). The French-Pinney IP’d for 276 BOPD, 486
MCFG, and 0 BWPD, and has produced over 401,537 BO, 718,456
MCFG, and 193,009 BW from the Red River.

4) Across the Missouri River from the Lewis & Clark #2-4H in the Todd
Field are the Zinke & Trumbo, Inc. Foster #1-32 [200’ FNL, 700’ FWL,
NW NW Section 32, T154N, R101W, Williams Co., N.D.] and the
Davidson #1 [670 FSL, 1,970’ FWL SE SW Section 29, T154N,
R101W, Williams Co., N.D.] both producing from the Nesson.

ENGINEERING

The surface location for the Lewis & Clark #2-4H is 2,094' from the North line &
332' from the East line, in the Southeast quarter of the Northeast quarter of Section 4,
Township 153 North, Range 101 West, McKenzie County, North Dakota. The well was
spudded with Nabors Drilling USA Rig #417 on April 13, 2003. Surface hole was drilled
with 13.75” bits and fresh water down to 3,008’. A string of 10.75” surface casing was
set and cemented at 3,008’. Drilling out of the surface casing commenced with 9.875”
bits and Invert Oil mud. Ice dams on the Missouri River caused flooding which
eventually threatened the location, therefore the drilling was suspended at 4,188’. The
drill string was tripped out and laid down and the derrick was laid over to await the
recession of the flood. The well was in suspense for 12 days. Drilling resumed after the
flood waters receded and the location and road dried out.

Drilling proceeded to the directional kick off point at 8,730’. A Baker Hughes
Inteq gyroscopic survey was made of the hole down to the kick off point to accurately
determine the starting point for directional operations. The results of the gyroscopic
survey placed the hole at 8,575’ at 35.4’ South and 38.3’ West of the surface location.
Baker Hughes Inteq provided directional supervision, and MWD with Gamma Ray for
the directional drilling operation. The first portion of the curve was built using 9.875” bits
down to a projected 70° at 9,224’ MD [Measured Depth]. A string of 7” and 7.625”
casing was run and cemented to 9,224’ MD. The drilling fluid was switched over to
fresh water with polymer sweeps for hole cleaning. The curve was drilled ahead with 6”
bits. The first mud motor out from intermediate casing under-performed both in

penetration rate and angle build and had to be replaced. Due to the poor performance
of the initial motor run after casing, the curve was landed in the Nesson at a steeper
angle than planned. The top of the Nesson was cut at a hole angle of 81 5°. The curve
was continued to bring the trajectory back up and leveled off in the upper Nesson.
However, the well path drilled back out the top of the Nesson into the overlying Midale
before the hole angle could be brought back to 90° (horizontal). The well path was
brought back down into the Nesson after drilling 530’ MD in the overlying Midale.

The well path traversed downward through the upper Nesson with only minor
shows. The first significant shows were observed around the mid-Nesson beginning at
10,207’ MD. The MWD stopped pulsing and the drilling string was tripped out at 10,455’
MD. After returning to drilling, the hole angle dropped while accomplishing the planned
azimuth turn to the west. At the same time the dip angle changed. These two factors
combined to cause the well path to drill out of the base of the Nesson by 10,560’ MD.
Also, shortly after resuming drilling the MWD gamma ray sensor failed and the lateral
was drilled ahead without benefit of the gamma ray data. The lateral was drilled ahead
to the original planned total depth (based on the hardline restrictions for the existing
spacing unit in the Northeast Quarter of Section 4). At 11,605’ MD (the end of Lateral
#1) the bottom hole location was projected at 1,230.87’ North and 1,709.7’ West of the
surface location. This equates to approximately 863.13’ FNL & 2,041.7’ FEL in the NW
NE Section 4.

A Schlumberger Platform Express Log Suite with FMI was run on drill pipe over
the open hole from the intermediate casing shoe to total depth in Lateral #1. Meanwhile
Nance Petroleum Corp. representatives went before the North Dakota Industrial
Commission — Oil & Gas Division to petition for a change in the spacing unit to include
the entire north half of Section 4. The request was granted, allowing the continuation of
the Lewis & Clark #2-4H lateral to the west. Analysis of the electric log data along with
the paucity of shows in the later portions of Lateral #1 seemed to indicate the need for
sidetracking the hole to maximize exposure to the more productive portions of the upper
Mission Canyon (Nesson).


The decision was made to pull back to 10,364’ MD and initiate an open hole
sidetrack while in the mid-Nesson show zone. Sidetrack #1 was started at 10,364’ MD
off of Lateral #1. Sidetrack #1 proceeded in zone, in the mid-Nesson porosity, until the
MWD stopped pulsing around 10,693’ MD. After the trip for MWD change the well path
was pushed up towards the top of the Nesson to check for possible porosity
development. Poor shows were encountered near the top of the Nesson and the well
path was steered back down to the mid-Nesson show zone. Pressure spikes, abundant
metal in the samples and reduced drill rates prompted a trip at 11,788’ MD. The well
path traversed through the mid-Nesson show zone for the next several hundred feet of
lateral, but the zone did not seem developed enough to “capture” the bit (to reduce the
need for constant steering corrections). Beginning around 12,600’ MD the well path
was steered back up to the top of the Nesson to check for porosity development. An
apparent “tight streak” held the well path down away from the top. At trip was made at
12,901’ MD to replace a failed MWD gamma sensor. After significant steering efforts
and time drilling, the “tight streak” was breached and the top Nesson porosity was
encountered. However, the hole angle achieved to break through the “tight streak” was
too great to keep from drilling out the top of the Nesson and into the overlying Midale.
The well path was brought back down into the Nesson in 120’ and the balance of
Sidetrack #1 was drilled in the upper Nesson.

Sidetrack #1 reached total depth at 13,755' MD, when drill string torque and drag
reached excessive levels for continued safe drilling. The Bottom Hole Location [BHL] at
total depth in Sidetrack #1 was 1,350.45’ North & 3,843.62’ West of the surface location
at approximately 743.6’ FNL & 1,116.8 FWL in the NW NW of Section 4.

The drilling of the Lewis & Clark #2-4H took 40 operating days (plus the 12 days
suspended due to flooding) and ~584 rotating hours. A total of 1,775 barrels of water
were lost during drilling. The Nesson laterals were left uncased for an acid stimulation
and horizontal completion.

GEOLOGIC EVALUATION

The geologic evaluation of the Lewis & Clark #2-4H began in the Charles
Formation (Mississippian in age) below the 1°‘ major salt. Sunburst Consulting provided
two well site geologists and a digital gas detection system. The digital gas information
was augmented by the use of a digital gas chromatograph. Drilling rig data (including
ROP [Rate of Penetration], on-off bottom status, and mud pump strokes) were received
through a digital connection to the rig EDR [Electronic Data Recorder]. The Sunburst
gas detection readings were returned for display and monitoring to the rig EDR.

Engineering and geologic data were then compiled and distributed on a digital drafting
and Internet communications system.

BUILD CURVE

After drilling down to the planned KOP at the base of the 2™ to last Charles Salt
the directional tools were picked up to begin the curve build portion of the well. The
base of the 2” to the last Charles salt came in at 8,732’ MD, 8,731’ TVD (-6859’) which
was 18’ low to prognosis. The Base Last Salt came in at 8,921’ MD, 8.909" TVD (-
7037’), also 18’ low to prognosis. The Ratcliffe interval of the lower Charlies was
encountered at 9,024' MD, 8,988' TVD, (-7116'), 20’ low to prognosis. There was a
slight hydrocarbon show identified within the Ratcliffe interval between 9,064’ and 9,078’
MD. Gas peaked at 71 units [1% methane in air = 100 units] with some “heavy gas”
components (C3s & C4s). Samples recovered from this Ratcliffe show interval included
Limestone: medium to light gray brown, very fine crystalline, occasional spotty black oil
Stain, dull green fluorescence, slow streaming cut in part, very poor intercrystalline
porosity, occasionally anhydritic. These shows were considered fair for the Ratcliffe
interval in this area, and warrant further investigation when taken together with the
much stronger show in the Basic Game & Fish well nearby.

The Midale interval (also a member of the Charles Formation) was topped at
9,149' MD, 9,064' TVD, (-7192'). There were only trace sample shows observed within
the Midale, with no significant background gas increases. The curve was built to near
70° where intermediate casing was set in the Midale interval of the lower Charles
Formation and the drilling fluid was switched from Invert Oil to fresh water.

The top of the Mission Canyon Formation (Nesson zone) was reached at 9,375’
MD, 9,142.6' TVD (-7270.6') in the curve building portion of the lateral. The Nesson top
came in a little over 20’ low to prognosis. Samples from the initial contact with the
Nesson contained Limestone: tan, cream, light brown, very fine crystalline, fragmental,
occasionally peloidal, spotty black oil stain, dull green fluorescence in part, slow
streaming cut in part, very poor interparticle porosity, occasional white to clear calcite
crystals. Although a respectable show for the Nesson, this was not as good a show as
that observed in the Basic Game & Fish well. Background gas readings increased only
slightly in the Nesson. Due to an unexpectedly aggressive angle build in the last portion
of the curve, the top of the Nesson was once again encountered at 9,520’ MD, 9,143.3’
TVD, as the well path moved back up stratigraphically. The well path was brought back
down into the Nesson from the overlying basal Midale argillaceous marker with some
difficulty, taking 530’ MD. The Nesson was re-entered at 10,050’ MD, 9,151.5’ TVD.
Part of the reason the Nesson was so difficult to get back down to may have been the
apparent 0.89° formation down dip during this portion of the lateral.

The gas and sample shows were slight following the re-entry into the Nesson at
10,050’ MD. The gamma ray values were also not as clean as the previous encounter
with the top portion of the Nesson. The first significant gas and sample shows were
observed beginning after 10,207' MD, 9,157.8’ TVD (-7285.8’), which was interpreted to
be the mid-Nesson (assuming a 16’ net thickness for the Nesson, this zone appeared
approximately 8’ down from the top). Gas peaks over 200 units with heavy gas
components were recorded as the lower 8’ of the Nesson were traversed between

pursued traversing back and forth through this upper Nesson porosity streak. The
porous interval appeared to be a foot or less in thickness and the bit did not seem to be
able to track in it. Therefore, steering was required to maintain relative contact with the
zone. By this time in the lateral steering (sliding) had become difficult and rotating was
the only option for drilling ahead. The Sidetrack #1 finished up with a natural traverse
up through the top Nesson porosity yielding good shows at 13,350’ MD to 13,550’ MD
and once again at 13,690’ MD to 13,750’ MD. Drilling was terminated at 13,755’ MD
when torque and drag parameters began to exceed reasonable safety limits.


10,207’ MD and 10,560’ MD. Samples did contain fragmental textures with occasional
peloids, but the high energy lithologies observed in the Basic Game & Fish were not
seen. The MWD gamma ray sensor failed around 10,450’ MD, therefore the higher
gamma signature marking the base of the Nesson was not recorded until later electric
logs. There were only trace shows observed from 10,560’ MD to total depth in Lateral
#1 at 11,605’ MD. Electric logs run on drill pipe at the 11,605’ TD helped to clarify the
stratigraphic position at that point, and illuminated the lack of porosity development in
the upper Nesson in Lateral #1. Electric logs pointed out good porosity development in
the lower half of the Nesson and significant fracture counts. The resistivities recorded in
the lower Nesson porosity intervals indicate good hydrocarbon saturation.

Cuttings photo 10,450’ MD

The decision was made to sidetrack off of Lateral #1 to maximize exposure to the
more porous mid-Nesson show intervals and seek out upper Nesson porosity
development should it occur further out in the lateral. Sidetrack #1 was initiated at
10,364’ MD, within the mid-Nesson show zone. Shows similar to those seen in the mid-
Nesson in Lateral #1 were seen once again in the early portions of Sidetrack #1. Once
the sidetrack had been established the well path was steered up to the top of the
Nesson to seek better porosity development. However, no significant high porosity was
encountered between 10,900’ MD and 11,700’ MD as the upper Nesson was traversed
up and back down. The mid-Nesson was explored between 11,750’ MD and 12,600’
MD, exhibiting good gas and fair sample shows. Another exploration of the upper
Nesson was made between 12,600’ MD and 12,900’ MD. A resistive “tight streak”
seemed to be holding the well path down from reaching the top of the Nesson. After
significant effort the “tight streak” was breached and some good porosity development
was discovered at the top of the Nesson. The gas readings were subdued due to the
Slow penetration rates sliding up through the “tight streak”, however samples looked
good. The contained Limestone: with fragmental and peloidal textures, spotty and
stylolitic black oil stain in small pin point vugs and slow to moderate streaming cuts.
The well path moved up into the overlying basal Midale argillaceous marker between
12,980’ MD and 13,100’ MD. Gas peaks of up to 200 units were recorded coming back
down through the uppermost Nesson porosity. The balance of the Lewis & Clark #2-4H

DIP ESTIMATES

Average formation dips were calculated using the multiple contact points with
known (or suspected) equivalent stratigraphic markers. The estimates are “straight line”
extrapolations, but serve to give an approximate average dip. The large variation in the
dip estimates may be due to the drilling of the lateral along the edge of a structure, or
minor short term variations in the dip. Interpreted and Gamma Ray documented top
and bottom of zone events are tabulated in the “Dip Estimates” table.

SUMMARY

The Lewis & Clark #2-4H was successfully steered to a horizontal penetration of
the Nesson zone of the Mission Canyon Formation. The lateral exposed a net 4,380'
following the initial penetrations of the top of the Nesson. The vast majority of the
lateral is interpreted to have been drilled within the Nesson or stratigraphically near the
Nesson. The Lewis & Clark #2-4H required 40 drilling days or approximately 584
rotating hours. The drilling operation generally went smoothly, with few delays or
problems. General sample quality was rated as fair in the lateral. The show quality in
the jateral was poor to fair, with obvious oil staining and visible open porosity only
evident in the mid-Nesson show zone and a thin streak at the top of the Nesson during

the final 900’ of lateral.

CONCLUSIONS

1) The well was kicked off in the lower Charles Formation (base of the 2° to
the last salt}, which came in 18’ low to prognosis.

2) A small show was encountered in the Ratcliffe, which corresponds to the
show interval seen in the nearby Basic Game & Fish #34-3H well.

3) The Lewis & Clark #2-4H was successfully steered to a horizontal
trajectory in the targeted Nesson zone of the Mission Canyon Formation.
One open hole sidetrack was performed to keep the well path in the target
zone. Tubing-conveyed electric logs were of significant help in devising
the revised targeting of the lateral and in identifying fracture density and
orientations.

4) There were 5,621' measured depth drilled in the two laterals following the
initial penetration of the Nesson (4,380’ from the initial entry point in
Lateral #1 to the end of Sidetrack #1). Of the total footage drilled (5,621’)
after initial penetration of the Nesson: 3,926’ (or 70%) were drilled in the
Nesson; 650’ (or 12%) were drilled just above the Nesson in the basal
Midale; and 1,045’ (or 18%) were drill below the Nesson.

5) Sample show and visual porosity estimates indicated fair hydrocarbon
production potential for the lateral. Fiuid losses indicate some
permeability. Electric logs caiculate favorably for the mid-Nesson porosity
exposed in Lateral #1.

6) The Lewis & Clark #2-4H awaits open hole completion in the Nesson
lateral following an acid stimulation with the drilling rig after TD.

McKenzie County, ND
Well File No. 15358

Dear Mr. Evertz:

We are in receipt of the Cement Bond Log run on the above referenced well, dated May
23, 2003. We have determined that the top of the cement behind the 7-inch casing string
is at a depth of 4914 feet. The top of the Newcastle Formation is picked from logs at
4891 feet. The North Dakota Administrative Code Section 43-02-03-21 requires that
sufficient cement be used to isolate the Dakota Group, of which the Newcastle Formation
is a part.

Since the Newcastle Formation is not properly isolated, approval may be given
permission to monitor the surface-production casing annulus. This approval may be
granted in lieu of an immediate cement squeeze, contingent upon the following
~ stipulations:

1. The surface — production casing annulus must be continuously
monitored with an accurate pressure gauge.

2. The pressure gauge must not be any higher than a 300-psi gauge.

3. All valves installed on the annulus must be exposed to the surface;
burial will be allowed only in the presence of an NDIC Oil and Gas
Division Inspector.

4, Any pressure development on the annulus must be immediately
reported to the Oil and Gas Division.

5. The Newcastle Formation must be isolated, as directed by the Oil and
Gas Division, upon the abandonment of the well.

RE: PERMIT TO DRILL
Lewis & Clark 2-4
SE NE 4-153N-101W
McKenzie Co.
Baker Field
Well File #15358
Dear Mr. Evertz:

Check No. M8897 in the amount of $100.00 was received. Enclosed find the approved
application for the above captioned well. It is requested that notification be given immediately
upon the spudding of the well. This information should be relayed to the Oil & Gas Division,
Bismarck, via telephone. The following information must be included: Well name, legal
location, permit number, drilling contractor, company representative, date and time of
spudding. Office hours are 8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. Central Time.
Our telephone number is (701) 328-8020.

Please be advised that conditions may be imposed on the use and reclamation of a
drilling reserve pit on this site if specific site conditions warrant. Also, please be advised
NDAC Section 43-02-03-31 requires the running of a log from which the presence of cement
can be determined in every well in which production or intermediate casing has been set.
Revisions to NDAC Section 43-02-03-31 effective September 1, 2000 require the operator to
run a Gamma Ray Log from total depth to ground level elevation of the well bore, and that all
logs shall be submitted as one paper copy and one digital copy in LAS (Log ASCII) format, or
a format approved by the Director.

Image logs that include, but are not limited to, Mud Logs, Cement Bond Logs, and
Cyberlook Logs, cannot be produced in their entirety as LAS (Log ASCII files. To create a
solution and establish a standard format for industry to follow when submitting image logs, the
Director has given approval for the operator to submit an image log as a TIFF (*.tif) formatted
file. The TIFF (*.tif) format will be accepted only when the log cannot be produced in its
entirety as a LAS (Log ASCII) file format. The digital copy may be submitted on a 3.5” floppy
diskette, a standard CD, or attached to an email sent to digitallogs@saturn_ndic state nd_us.

Thank you for your cooperation,

Sincerely,
Me LE

Comments
This is a proposed grass roots horizontal Madison well. The proposed surface (ocation has been approved by the Carp of Engineers and Nroth
Dakota Game & Fish. The pad and location need to be built before the ground freezes due to requirements of placing a ground stabitizatian
membrane under the road and location. The drilling of this well ls dependent on the results of our sidetrack and horizontal lateral of the Basic
Game & Fish 34-3. If that well is successful, we plan to drill the Lewis & Clark 2-4 in January 2003, An exact well plan will be submitted prior to
moving in a rig, showing casing program, mud program and horizontal path.

McKenzie County, North Dakota
Dear Bob:

Enclosed is a copy of the final Muéri- Point Surface Use and Operations Plan for the Zinke
& Trumbo, Inc. Lewis & Clark 2-4 well.

Please review the Plan, sign and return three executed copies to me. I will then forward a
copy to the Corps of Engineers and Nance Petroleum.

Please note that under our Exhibit E: Cut and Fill Cross-Section, the diagram needs to be
changed to show the dikes at a total elevation at 1,858". This coincides with our Multi-Point
Surface Use and Operations Plan. This may be modified when we file the State permit.

Background for your information

This draft has gone through extensive review with the Corps of Engineers, Nance
Petroleum, Zavanna, LLC and yourrepresentative, Rick Bumett. This is a workable plan for
the parties. After this Muiti-Point Surface Use and Operations Plan is signed and returned
to the Corps, the Corps will issue a letter approving it and attaching it as an exhibit. Our
map will also be attached along with the letter.

Once the Corps has returned the letter, we will then assign the Lewis & Clark 2-4 permit
and Multi-Point Surface Use and Operations Plan to Nance (subject to our JOA and Corps
approval) dwho will sign off, ratifying and assuming the obligations under the permit.

MULTIPOINT REQUIREMENTS

SURFACE USE PLANS

Existing Roads

A. The proposed wellsite and surveyor's plat is shown on Exhibit “D”.

B. To drive to the wellsite, you drive 3.3 miles south of the junction of U.S. Highway 2
and U.S. Highway 85 to the Section line between Section 5 and Section 8 and turn
east on an elevated graveled road and go east 2.05 miles. Then turn north and go 0.65
miles on an existing road to junction of new access road. The new access road goes
0.15 of a mile NFMo the proposed drill site pad. The proposed wellsite pad is 6.2
miles from the junction of U.S, Highway 2 and U.S. Highway 85 and 10.0 miles from
Williston, North Dakota.

C. The existing roads will be maintained in as good or better condition than they were
before the drilling and completion operations commenced.

D. Exhibit “A” shows the route from Williston, North Dakota to the proposed wellsite.
Access Roads
The access road is divided into two parts. The first part is the Access Road from the
French Pinney to the Gate and the second part is the Access Road from the Gate to the
Location.
A. Access Road from the French Pinney to the Gate.
This portion of the total road starts from the existing gravel road at the
French Pinney and stops at the North Dakota Game & Fish gate ("Gate")
approximately 2,904 feet from the French Pinney location or .55 miles.
The new access road will be built on a ground stabilizing liner such as

Dupont's Typar. The liner will be placed on the excisting surface and all
road construction material placed on the liner.

Page 2 Final
9/27/02

Regardless of the outcome of the proposed well, this section of the Access
Road will not be reclaimed. However, if the well is completed as a producer
it will be upgraded according to sub-section 2C herein.

bd

Access Road from the Gate to the Location.

This portion of the total road starts from the existing Gate and will end at the
Location. The Access Road from the Gate to the Location is approximately
924 feet or .17 miles.

The new access road will be built on a ground stabilizing liner such as
Dupont's Typar. The liner will be placed on the excisting surface and all
road construction material placed on the liner.

Ifthe proposed well is a dry hole, the Access Road from the Gate to the
Location will be reclaimed within six (6) months, pending weather
conditions.

Upgrade of Access Roads

If the proposed well is completed as a producer, the Access Roads will be
upgraded with three (3) inches of gravel. In addition, the following upgrades
will be made:

lt) The width of the new access road will be a maximum of 25’ wide.
2) The maximum grade will be 2 percent.
3) No cuts or fills will be required.

4) No turnouts will be required. If the well is a producer, a public parking lot
measuring 40' x 60! will be constructed adjacent to the access roads and well
pad.

5) No additional drainage consisting of ditching or water bars will be required.
6) A culvert of sufficient size will be installed at the Gate.

7) Acattle guard or gate maybe required near the drill pad entrance.

8) Cross country traffic will not be allowed.

9) No additional surface material should be required. If any surfacing material is
required it will be obtained from private contractors unless otherwise agreed and
will be free from noxious weeds. The Corps of Engineers will be notified of the
source point of all fill material prior to road construction.

10) Exhibit “B” shows roads within a three mile radius of the proposed well.

it) The Access Road from the Gate to the Location and parking lot will be fenced
with a two (2) strand wire fence on both sides to prevent cross country traffic.
A walk-through gate will be installed near the parking lot. This fence and gate
will be instailed prior to drilling.

. Material for Access Roads

Dirt filt from the man-made drainage ditches may be used for the building up of the
Access Roads and Location. However, approval, in writing, must first be obtained
from the North Dakota Game & Fish. The approval letter will have attached a map
indicating the location of such drainage ditches and any requirements associated
therewith.

Location of Existing Wells

>

. Exhibit “C” shows all the existing wells in a one-mile radius of the proposed well.

. There are no injection wells within a one-mile radius of the proposed well.

. There is one plugged and abandoned well within a one-mile radius of the proposed

well. The Cox-Miidred #1 in Section 4.
. There are no disposal wells within a one-mile radius of the proposed well.

There are no drilling wells within a one-mile radius of this well as of September 4,
2002.

There are two producing wells within a one-mile radius of the proposed well and they
are listed below:

1) John L. Cox #31-10 Basic Corps of Engr. (660' FNL & 2305' FEL) Sec. 10 (Red
River);
2) John L. Cox 24-3 French Pinney (660' FSL & 1985' FWL) Sec. 3 (Red River).

. There are no shut-in gas or oil wells within a one-mile radius of the proposed well.

. There are no monitoring or observation wells within a one-mile radius of the
proposed well.

Location of Existing or Proposed Facilities

A. Zinke and Trumbo, Inc. do not have any oil and gas production facilities within a five

B

mile radius of the proposed well.

. Exhibits “D” and “E” show the surveyed location and the anticipated cut and fill. The
production pad layout is shown on Exhibit “F”. The drilling pad will be built up 2.1
feet to elevation 1851’ m.s.1. and a ring dike built around the location 7' high to

Page 4 Final
9/27/02

clevation 1858' m.s.l, and cross-section as shown in Exhibit “E”. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, the ring dike is only required if the well is a
producer,

C. If this proposed well is successfully completed as a producer, the production
equipment will be located on the wellsite pad as shown on Exhibit “G”, The
equipment will be painted a flat tan color.

D. The soil used in construction of the pad base will be treated with a ground stabilizer
material such as Dupont's Typar. Fill dirt and scoria will be placed on top of that
material to increase the height of the location pad to 1851’ elevation. The material to
raise the height of the location will be purchased from private contractors or from the
area if prior approval, in writing, is obtained from the North Dakota Fish and Game,
Williston, North Dakota and will be free from noxious weeds. Dikes will be installed
to make sure that no hydrocarbons can escape from the site and any spill of
hydrocarbons can be easily and rapidly recovered and the spill area cleaned up.

E. New facilities contemplated if well is completed as a producer are shown on Exhibit
“GO”,

1) Proposed tank battery and production equipment are as shown on Exhibit “G”.
Tanks and treater will be diked immediately upon production. Transfer pipes
between tanks and treater will be diked or buried. Tanks will be diked to one
hundred fifty percent (150%) of capacity.

2) Dimension of the facilities are shown on Exhibit “G”.
3) All gas emissions will be combined into one flare pit.

4) All Ajax pump motors will be fitted and maintained with Hospital Grade
mufflers that will meet state and local decibel limits.

5) The soil will be stabilized with ground stabilization material, such as Dupont’s
20 mil thickness Typar or similar material with 200 psi burst strength.

Fill dirt will be obtained from approved outside sources, unless otherwise
agreed to, and scoria will then be placed on top of that material to raise the
location.

Construction methods will be employed to assure that drainage flows are
impounded to prevent the loss of any hydrocarbon from the site. This is to be
done in a manner to facilitate rapid recovery and clean up.

Page 5 Final
9/27/02

6) Protective measures to protect wildlife and livestock will be taken as follows:

a) Weights on the pumping unit will be enclosed.

b) Production (flare pit) will be diked.

c) The entire exterior of the well pad will be fenced with a two (2) strand
fence,

F. Upon completion of well, areas required for continued use will be graded to provide
drainage and minimize erosion. Those areas unnecessary for use will be be reclaimed
by removing all fill dirt, scoira and the liner from lands of the United States. The
reclaimed areas will be seeded with a grass mixture as _prescribedby the Corps of
Engineers and the North Dakota Game and Fish Department. It is recognized that
additional wells may be drilled from the initial location and if the proposed well is a
producer, the reclamation process will not start until one year after first production,
The time period will allow the planning and drilling of one or more additional wells,

Location and Type of Water Supply

A. Fresh water for spudding and drilling the first 3,000 feet will be purchased form the
City of Williston and will be trucked to the location over the roads shown on Exhibit
“B”. Sait water for the salt-saturated mud system will be trucked from Williston.

B. Salt and fresh water will be trucked to location over the roads marked on Exhibit
“R”.

Source of Construction Materials

A. Exhibit “H” shows the layout of the planned pad for drilling purposes. This layout
represents the maximum area to be disturbed. We calculate this pad will cover an
area from the spotted location extending approximately 150' cast, 150' west, 200
south, and 200° north.

This location will be built by first laying down a ground stabilization material, such as

DuPont’s 20 mil thickness Typar with 200 psi burst strength. This will be laid directly
on top of the ground, and the surface will be built-up with one foot, six inches (1'6") of
soil, and an additional six (6) inches of scoria to a base elevation of 1851‘ m.s.1, for the
entire drilling pad.

The area to be made into a drain pit (6' x 20’) will be constructed entirely above the
current surface elevation.Drain pit will be lined with Dupont’s 20 mil thickness non-

porous Typar with 200 psi burst strength.

The drain pit will be fenced with a two (2) strand fence on three sides during drilling
and on the fourth side once the rig is removed.

If the well is productive, the drillsite will be reclaimed in accordance with Paragraph

Page 6 — Final
9/27/02

7.

4.F. and an area sufficient for the wellhead and a completion rig will be left at the
proposed drillsite. The production equipment will then be installed as shown on
Exhibit “G”. The production padwill be ring diked to a minimum elevation of 1,858:
m.s.I. Gravel will then be placed on the production pad. Construction materials will
consist of soil, scoria and gravel brought in from private sources and free of noxious
weeds. Gravel will be used as needed. The Corps of Engineers will be notified of the
source point of all fill material prior to placement.

B. The pianned site and access roads are outleased to the North Dakota Game and Fish
Department.

C. All gravel (containing no noxious weeds) will be obtained from private land in
quantities necessary for the road surfacing and tank base material on the battery site.

Methods of Handling Waste Disposal for Totally Closed System (No Reserve Pit)

The well is being drilled to a depth of 3,000 feet or the Fox Hills formation, whichever
occurs first, with fresh water. From that depth on, salt water or oil base will be used. All
cuttings and salt saturated material generated will be hauled off location during and after
completion of the well. Upon the completion of drilling operations, all waste materials
including, but not limited to drill cuttings, drilling fluids, and all trash, shall be completely
removed from Government land as directed by the Project Manager, Garrison Project. No
waste material shall be buried onsite.

Containment of drilling fluids will be in three (3) steel pits and two (2) reserve steel pits.
Each steel pit has a capacity of 400-500 bartels, contents of which will be hauled arity to
an approved disposal system. The Corps of Engineers shall be notified of the location‘of
the disposal site prior to drilling the well.

A. All drill cuttings will be hauled from site to an approved disposal site during drilling
operations. Drain pit (6' x 20') will be lined with Dupont’s 20 mil thickness Typar with
200 psi burst strength.

B. All excess fresh water drilling fluids and solids will be removed from site to an
approved disposal site.

C. At 3,000 feet, the well will be switching over to a brine system. All liquid and solid
waste that is produced will be hauled from the site, either during or immediately after
drilling is completed. All waste stored on location during drilling activities will be
stored in steel containers or in a drain pit lined with 20 mil plastic liner with a minimum
200 psi burst strength. Salt water tanks will be located entirely on the drilling location
within the location dike.

Page 7 Final
9/27/02

D. No produced water is expected while drilling. The amount of hydrocarbon that may be

produced while testing will be stored in a steel tank. Previous to clean up operations,
the hydrocarbon material will be removed by hauling to an approved disposal site as the
situation would dictate.

:. Sanitary facilities will consist of chemical toilets, Waste will be contained and hauled

from the site weekly during drilling operations and immediately following drilling
operations.

. Garbage, flamable and nonflammable waste are to be contained in the trash container.

- All trash, garbage, etc.. is to be gathered and hauled from the site at the end of the
drilling operations. Trash and drain pits will be filled as soon as the rig leaves the
location. All liners will be removed from the pits prior to backfilling.

Ancillary Facilities

There are no airstrips, camps or other facilities planned during the drilling of the
proposed well.

Wellsite Lavout

A. See Exhibit “E” for a cross section of the drill pad with cut and fills. Exhibit “E”
shows that there will be three foot or more of fill on the drill pad.

B. Rig layout is shown on Exhibit “H”. No permanent living facilities are planned.
However, during drilling operations, three trailers will be on location.

C. Location of mud tanks; drain pit; pipe racks; and soil material stockpiles are shown
on Exhibits “H”.

Plans for Restoration of the Surface

A. If the well will be completed as a dryhole:

1) Ail restoration procedures will be coordinated with the Corps and North Dakota
Game & Fish Department. The drain pit will be emptied immediately, and the pit
liner removed, pit backfilled, leveled and contoured. Prior to backfilling, the
Corp of Engincers will observe and approve pit cleanup. The drain pit will be
reclaimed within 31 days after finishing drilling this well.

Page 8 Final
9/27/02

11.

2) When the access road (from the Gate to the Location) is not needed all fill
material and the ground liner will be removed and the surface reseeded with a
seed mixture prescribed by the North Dakota Game & Fish Department,

3) Ifthere is any oil in the drain pit, it will be removed immediately after drilling.
Produced fluids, drill hole cuttings and fluids and the stee] containment tanks will
be removed immediately after drilling.

4) Rehabilitation operations will begin immediately after the drilling rig is removed.
Produced fluids will be stored in test tanks. All fill material, scoria, gravel and
the ground liner will be removed from lands of the United States, Reseeding and
revegetation operations shall be accomplished in accordance with the instructions,
and to the satisfaction of the Project Manager, Garrison Project. The entire
reclamation process will be completed within six (6) months after finishing
drilling the well

B. If the proposed well is completed as a producer:

1) The drain pit will be reclaimed and backfilled and all excess liquids will be hauled
off site, immediately after well completion.

2) The road will be upgraded as discussed in Section 2 and the production pad will
be reduced in areal extent as discussed in Section 4F. The area to be returned to
the Game and Fish will be reclaimed within six (6) months after finishing drilling
the well. The reclamation will consist of removing all fill material and the
ground liner and seeding with a seed mixture prescribed by the North Dakota
Game & Fish Department.

3) The production pad is in a 100 year flood plain. Any facilities and equipment
which can be damaged by floodwater and which cannot be readily moved if a
flood is imminent will be placed at a location above, or adequately protected by
diking to 1858", the 100 year flood water surface elevation.

Protection of Habitat Areas

Flood gauges will be installed on each location and on the access road. The construction
of the ring dike and implementation of the Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure
Plan will further protect the area. If the area should be determined to be in danger of
inundation above the planned protected area, operator will immediately shut-in the well,
haul from the tease all oil production from the oit storage tanks, and salt water from the
salt water tank. The tanks will then be filled with fresh water to prevent further danger if
the area is inundated, A tubing hanger plug will be installed in wellhead as an additional
security measure, if the well will still flow. The entire shut-in process will require a
minimum of twenty-four (24) hours to a maximum of forty-eight (48) hours. Operator
will be in daily contact with officials at the Garrison Dam for updated flood information.
Production will not be resumed until approval is received from the Corp of Engineers an

Well File #15358
Dear Mr. Evertz:

Pursuant to Commission Order No. 9277, approval to deviate the well bore of the
above captioned well is hereby given.

The approval is granted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated
by cement, be no closer than 500 feet from the 480 acre spacing unit, consisting of the NE/4 of
Sec. 4 and the N2 of Sec. 3-153N-101W. Inaccuracy of the survey equipment must be
considered when determining compliance with setbacks. Tail cement utilized on surface casing
must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi within 12 hours, and tail cement utilized
on production casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi before drilling the
plug or initiating tests.

All directional surveys of the well showing the location of the well bore shall be filed
with the Industrial Commission within 30 days after completion of the well. Such survey must
be certified by a representative of the survey contractor and mailed directly to us by the
contractor. Survey points shali be of such frequency to accurately determine the entire location
of the well bore.

Sincerely,

Kelly Triplett
