RE: North Dakota Administrative Code (NDAC) Section 43-02-03-49
Perimeter Berm Requirement

NDIC# Please see attached list of 10 Facilities

Dear Michael Kukuk:

Please be advised that the attached list of facilities require a perimeter berm to be constructed within 180 days of
this notice because they have:

1. Storage tanks;
2. Daily throughput of more than one hundred barrels of fluid per day; and
3. Includes production equipment or load lines that are not contained within secondary containment dikes

The berm must be at least six inches in height, constructed of sufficiently impermeable material to provide
emergency containment, and must be maintained until the facility is either granted a waiver or the site is
reclaimed.

Pursuant to NDAC Section 43-02-03-49 - Within one hundred eighty days from the date the operator is notified by
the Commission, a perimeter berm, at least six inches in height, must be constructed of sufficiently impermeable
material to provide emergency containment and to divert surface drainage away from the site around all storage
facilities and production sites that include storage tanks, have a daily throughput of more than one hundred
barrels of fluid per day, and include production equipment or load lines that are not contained within secondary
containment dikes. The Director may consider an extension of time to implement these requirements if
conditions prevent timely construction, or modification of these requirements if other factors are present that
provide sufficient protection from environmental impacts.

This perimeter berm requirement may be modified or waived if the operator can demonstrate that other factors
are present that provide sufficient protection from environmental impacts. A Sundry Notice (Form 4) outlining any
engineering controls or other factors must be submitted to the Commission for approval of this modification or
waiver. Should you have any questions regarding this matter, feel free to contact me at 701-770-3554.

Sincerely,

1.0 INTRODUCTION

Dahl Federal 2-15H is a north lateral Middle Bakken well located NW/NE in SEC 15, T153N,
R101 W, in McKenzie County, North Dakota. The primary target zone was 7’- 17’ under the top
of the Middle Bakken Formation. Although the entire Middle Bakken is considered a pay zone,
the target zone is used primarily because of its distinct gamma characteristics which are used to
help directional drill the lateral. Directional and MWD services were performed by Ryan Energy
Company. Joe Hallgren was the well-site geologist providing geo-steering and mudlogging
services were provided by Basin Geologic Consulting, Inc.

O 3.0 GEOLOGY

3.1 Formation Tops

Uphole formation tops were picked using ROP, lithology, and gamma ray to identify markers in
the curve and lateral (Table 3.1).

Table 3.1 Formation tops

3.2 Lithology

Detailed descriptions of samples logged are provided in the mudlog and horizontal log. A
description of the target zone is provided below

SLTY DOL: med- dk brn, med- dk gybrn, sme It gy, sl- mod frm, micxl, mod- v calc, mod arg, fr

g immed bri bl/wh flash- mlky cut.

3.3 Formation Dip

3.3.1 Main Horizontal

The formation had an average dip of 90.41°. Dip calculations were conducted along the
entire length of the lateral from entry into the Upper Bakken Shale at 10824? MD to TD
of 20924’ MD, using gamma ray, lithology, and anticipated structure. Dip changes can
be found in Table 3.2.

2.0 SERVICES

2.1 Wellsite Geology (Basin Geologic Consulting, Inc.)

Geological consulting and mudlogging started on 3/11/2012. Services provided included;
morning reports, sample examination, production of mud and horizontal log, geo-steering, and a
final end of well report.

2.2 Mudlogging (Basin Geologic Consulting, Inc.)
2.2.1 Sample Examination

Samples were collected every 30’ from 8450’ MD to the end of the lateral at 20924’ MD.
Descriptions included; mineralogy, color, firmness, argillaceous content, structure, texture,
allochems, porosity, oil stain, and hydrocarbon fluorescence. Carbonate identification was
determined with 10% dilute HCI, and alizarin red. Hydrocarbon fluorescence was determined
using a fluoroscope with a UV lamp.

2.2.2 Gas Detection

Gas was logged using the Pason Total Gas System (TGAS). The Pason TGAS is an unmanned
system designed to measure the amount of gases exiting the wellbore and then calculate the lag
time to show the formation depth where the gases were produced. Gas samples are collected and
analyzed right at the shaker. The Pason TGAS works in conjuction with the Pason EDR which
displays historical and current total percent pas at a specific depth or time. The Pason TGAS
system also changes lag time calculations to optimize accuracy of data using five different
formula options.

4.2 Gas Shows

The average range of the background gas from the casing shoe to when we began going thru the
gas buster at 14477’ MD was from 350 units to 1125 units. After we began going thru the gas
buster at 14477’ MD, the average range of the background gas was from 150 units to 400 units.
The highest background gas was when we drilled near the top of the target zone from 11100”
MD to 11400’ MD. The background gas was between 1000 units to 1125 units. A trip at 11024’
MD produced 3090 units of trip gas. At TD, the bottoms up gas was 323 units. After going thru
the gas buster, the gas flare was between 1’- 6’ high The mud weight for the lateral was
between 9.9 to 10.1. A chart showing the cross section of the wellbore with the rop, gas, gamma
ray, oil shows and mud weight data can be found in Figure 1.

> Table 3.2 Formation Dip Calculations

4.0 SHOWS

The hydrocarbon shows in the samples were good to very good for the whole lateral. We had
good sample quality until about 19950’ MD when the samples started becoming saturated with
envirotorque. At that point, the envirotorque saturation made some of the samples difficult for
the geologist and mudlogger to evaluate. The geologist and mudlogger attempted to wash the
envirotorque from the samples using soap and citra-solve but the envirotorque could not be
washed away. Envirotorque use in the well caused poor sample quality and therefore the
accuracy of sample descriptions was compromised from 19950’ MD to TD of 20924’ MD.
There was good brown oil staining in the samples while drilling the lateral. We had between 50-
90% bright yellow hydrocarbon fluorescence. The cuts were good to very good immediate
bright blue/white flash to milky to sometimes streaming cuts. Ronsonol was used to cut samples
and then view under a UV fluoroscope.

4.1 Oil Shows

The oil shows at the possum belly for this well were between a trace to 30% of dark to light
green to yellow to brownish/green oil. The oil was more green to yellow until the addition of
envirotorque and then we saw more brownish/green oil in the possum belly.

DETAILS OF WORK

Drilled the 8 3/4" curve from 10,260' - 11,009’, then ran 7" 29 - 324 HCL-80 casing to 7,740". The hole was tight, so we
pulled the casing and reamed the tight spots in the Dakota upper salts and the Charles. Ran the 7" 29 - 32# HCL-80
casing in to 10,956". Unable to circulate casing. Perforated the 7" 29# casing from 10,798' - 10,800' with eight .25"
holes and cemented the first stage with 167 sks of cement. Cemented the second stage with 689 sks of cement.
Pressure tested the casing slips, packoff, BOP, blind rams and pipe rams and valves to 5000#, annular to 2500# and
casing to 1500#. Drilled out the cement across the perfs at 10,798' - 10,800' and pressure tested the casing to 500%.

DETAILS OF WORK

Follow up to our sundry of 3-21-12: SM Energy requests approval to resume drilling the lateral to TD where a 4-1/2"
liner with swell packers will then be run. With the 7” casing at TD, no circulation was established. The 7" was
perfed in the Carrington at 10,798 - 10,800’MD (10,650' TVD) with 8 holes. Circulation was established. The 7" Csg
was cemented with 167 sx In the first stage and 689 sx of total cement in the second stage putting cmt 500’ over the
top of the Dakota. The DV was drilled out at 9336' and the cmt across the perfs at 10,798' was drilled out. Csg was
pressure tested to 500 psi. The float collar at 10,866' was drilled out and csg cleaned out to the float shoe at 10,948".
A CIBP was run in and set above the shoe at 10,943’. The bottom shoe jt was then perforated at 10,938'-10,936',
10,934'-10,932', 10930'-10,928'. A CICR was set at 10,902' whereby a cmt squeeze was attempted into the
perforations at 10,938’ - 10,928', however no injection rate into the perfs was able to be established with a pressure
applied of 1.1 psi/ft (6500 psi surface pressure). At this point SM Energy requests approval to drill out the CICR,
CIBP and the float shoe. The 6' lateral will be drilled from 11,009" to an estimated TD of 21,015’. A 4-1/2" liner will be
run with 21 swell packers. Dual swell packers will be run at approximately 11,040' (348' inside the 1280 spacing unit)
with the first frac port sleeve at approximately 11,275".

*SM Energy must request a hearing per NDAC 43-02-03-18.1. SM Energy must accept all liability associated with the above

procedure and isolation approval is contingent upon a decision rendered by the Commission at a hearing. Cannot frac until

after a hearing and Commission decision.

DETAILS OF WORK
SM ENERGY CO. REQUESTS APPROVAL TO PERFORATE THE 7" CASING FOR THE PURPOSE OF ESTABLISHING
CIRCULATION IN ORDER TO CEMENT THE 7" CASING. THE 8-3/4" INTERMEDIATE HOLE WAS DRILLED TO A TD OF
11,009’ IN THE M. BAKKEN, 7" CASING WAS RUN IN THE HOLE TO A DEPTH OF 10,956’ AT WHICH TIME IT IS
BELIEVED THAT THE U. BAKKEN SHALE HAS BECOME UNSTABLE AND STUCK THE CASING. ATTEMPTS HAVE
BEEN MADE TO FREE THE CASING AND AS MUCH AS 2000 PSI OF PRESSURE HAS BEEN APPLIED, BUT
CIRCULATION IS UNABLE TO BE ESTABLISHED. WE REQUEST THE APPROVAL TO PERFORATE THE 7" CASING @
10,791' MD (10,647' TVD) IN THE CARRINGTON FORMATION ABOVE THE U. BAKKEN SHALE. FIELD EXPERIENCE
HAS PROVEN THAT THIS IS THE LOCATION WITH THE HIGHEST PROBABILITY OF ESTABLISHING CIRCULATION.
BECAUSE THE POINT OF PERFORATION DOES NOT SATISFY THE 200° SETBACK REQUIREMENT FOR CEMENT
ISOLATION, UPON COMPLETION OF THE PRIMARY CEMENTING JOB, SM ENERGY CO. WILL SQUEEZE CEMENT
AROUND THE CASING SHOE, WE WILL ACCOMPLISH THIS AS FOLLOWS: DRILL OUT THE FLOAT EQUIPMENT,
SET A COMPOSITE BRIDGE PLUG @ APPROXIMATELY 10,950' MD, RUN TUBING CONVEYED PERFORATING GUNS
TO A DEPTH OF 10,940'MD AND PERFORATE SQUEEZE HOLES. SET A COMPOSITE CEMENT RETAINER @ 10,925’
AND RUN IN WITH DRILLPIPE AND PUMP AND SQUEEZE 44 SACKS OF CEMENT AROUND CASING SHOE. THE
PERFORATION HOLES @ 10,940’ MD WILL BE 252" NORTH OF THE SOUTH LINE OF SEC. 10 - T153N - R101W,

DETAILS OF WORK

SM Energy Company requests permission for suspension of drilling for up to 90 days for the referenced well under
NDAC 43-02-03-55. SM Energy Company intends to drill the surface hole with freshwater based drilling mud and set
surface casing with a small drilling rig and move off within 3 to 5 days. The casing will be set at a depth
pre-approved by the NDIC per the Application for Permit to Drill NDAC 43-02-03-21. No saltwater will be used In the
drilling and cementing operations of the surface casing. Once the surface casing is cemented, a plug or mechanical
seal will be placed at the top of the casing to prevent any foreign matter from getting into the well. A rig capable of
drilling to TD will move onto the location within the 90 days previously outlined to complete the drilling and casing
plan as per the APD. The undersigned states that this request for suspension of drilling operations in accordance
with the Subsection 4 of Section 43-02-03-55 of the NDAC, is being requested to take advantage of the cost savings
and time savings of using an initial rig that is smaller than the rig necessary fo drill a well to total depth but is not
intended to alter or extend the terms and conditions of, or suspend any obligation under, any oll and gas lease with
acreage in or under the spacing or drilling unit for the above-referenced well. SM Energy Company understands
NDAC 43-02-03-31 requirements regarding confidentiality pertaining to this permit. The lined reserve pit will be
fenced immediately after construction if the well pad is located in a pasture (NDAC 43-02-03-19 & 19.1), SM Energy
Company will plug and abandon the well and reclalm the well site if the well is not drilled by the larger rotary rig
within 90 days after spudding the well with the smaller drilling rig.

Survey Requirements for Horizontal, Horizontal Re-entry, and Directional Wells

NDAC Section 43-02-03-25 (Deviation Tests and Directional Surveys) states in part (that) the survey
contractor shall file a certified copy of all surveys with the director free of charge within thirty days of completion.
Surveys must be submitted as one electronic copy, or in a form approved by the director. However, the director
may require the directional survey to be filed immediately after completion if the survey is needed to conduct the
operation of the director's office in a timely manner. Certified surveys must be submitted via email in one adobe
document, with a certification cover page to certsurvey@nd.gov.
Survey points shall be of such frequency to accurately determine the entire location of the well bore.

Confidential status

Your request for confidential status of all information furnished to the Director, or his representatives, is
hereby granted. Such information, except production runs, shall remain confidential for six months commencing
on the date the well is spud.

Confidential status notwithstanding, the Director and his representatives shall have access to all well
records wherever located. Your company personnel, or any person performing work for your company shall
permit the Director and his representatives to come upon any lease, property, well, or drilling rig operated or
controlled by them, complying with all safety rules, and to inspect the records and operation of such wells and to
have access at all times to any and all records of wells. The Commission's field personnel periodically inspect
producing and drilling wells. Any information regarding such wells shall be made available to them at any time
upon request. The information so obtained by the field personnel shall be maintained in strict confidence and
shall be available only to the Commission and its staff.

Drilling pit
Please be advised approval for use of a drilling reserve pit or drill cuttings pit on this site is contingent on
site specific conditions and special pit closure requirements may apply.

Surface casing cement
