DETAILS OF WORK

Oasis Petroleum North America LLC requests a waiver from the tubing/pkr requirement included in

NDAC 43-02-03-21: Casing, tubing, and cementing requirements during the completion period immediately
following the upcoming fracture stimulation.

The following assurances apply:

. The well is equipped with new 29# & 32# casing at surface with an API burst rating of 11,220 psi

. The frac design will use a safety factor of 0.85 API burst rating to determine the maximum pressure.

. Damage to the casing during the frac would be detected immediately by monitoring equipment.

. The casing is exposed to significantly lower rates and pressures during flow back than during the frac job.
. The frac fluid and formation fluids have very low corrosion and erosion rates.

. Production equipment will be installed as soon as possible after the well ceases flowing.

. A 300# gauge will be installed on the surface casing during the flowback period.

INTRODUCTION

The Oasis Petroleum North American, LLC. Innoko 5301 43-12T [SW SE Section 12, T153N,
R101 W] is located approximately 20 miles south of Williston, North Dakota. The well was spud
on July 2, 2013 with Nabors drilling rig B25, and represents Oasis Petroleum’s continuing
development of the Three Forks Formation within Baker Field (Figure 1). The well was planned
to drill an approximately 9,288’ long lateral, along a proposed azimuth of 181.25°. The well-
bore will be enhanced for production by multi-stage fracture stimulation.

OFFSET CONTROL INFORMATION

Three wells were used to develop a well-rounded prognosis of offset tops prior to drilling the
Innoko 5301 43-12T. The Gulf Oil-Lindvig 1-11-3C [NW NE Sec. 11, T152N, R101 W] is
located approximately 0.71 miles northwest, the Oasis-Petroleum Bray 5301 43-12H is located
0.90 miles east [SW SE Sec. 12, T153N, R101 W], and the most recent offset control well, the
Oasis- Yukon 5301 41-12T [SW SW Sec. 12, T153N, R101W], is located approximately 0.4
miles southeast of the subject well (Figure 2).

Figure 2: Offsetting control wells in relation to the Innoko 5301 43-12T well.

Kick-off point for the curve was established from the isopach of the “base last salt” marker to the
Three Forks “target” in the offset wells. The Lindvig 1-11-3C was used as the primary offset
through the vertical and curve sections. The curve was successfully landed within the Three
Forks Formation at 10,839’ TVD.

GEOLOGIC EVALUATION
Methods:

Geologic supervision for the Innoko 5301 43-12T was provided by Sunburst Consulting,
Inc. with two well-site geologists. A digital gas detector and chromatograph were
interfaced with a Pason electronic data recorder system (EDR). The EDR provided drill
rate, on-off bottom and pump strokes to the gas detection computer and received total gas
information from Sunburst for viewing around location. Lagged samples were caught by
the rig crew in 30’ intervals from 8,300’ MD to 10,850’ MD, 10’ intervals from 10,850’
MD to 11,080’ MD, and 30’ intervals from 11,080’ MD to 21,122’. Wet and dry cuttings
were examined under a binocular microscope. Complete lithologic descriptions &
sampling intervals are provided in the lithology document within this evaluation. Two sets
of dry cuttings were collected during the duration of the well. One set was sent to Oasis
Petroleum North American, LLC, and the other to the State of North Dakota. Evidence of
light hydrocarbons present in the drilling fluid was reported by the gas chromatography
equipment and documented on the mud log presented with this report.

Vertical & Curve Operations:

On July 2, 2013 the Innoko 5301 43-12T was spud by Nabors drilling rig B25. A 134%” hole was
drilled with freshwater to 2,111’ where the well-bore was isolated with 9 %” casing and
cemented to surface. From this depth, an 8 34” Smith MDSI616 bit was used to drill out of
casing, using diesel invert drilling fluid. Invert fluid was used throughout the remaining vertical
and curve sections, maintaining a mud weight of 9.6-10.3 (ppg) for stable-hole conditions. The
vertical hole was drilled to a kick-off point (KOP) of 10,300’ MD where the curve-build was
initiated.

While drilling the curve, gamma-ray signatures were compared to those of the three offsets.
Target projections from the False Bakken marker provided a reliable landing target (Figure 3).
On the night of July 11, 2013 the curve was landed at a depth of 11,121’ MD (10,839’ TVD),
placing the well-bore approximately 16’ below the top of the target zone. Directional tools were
then pulled out of the hole and a string of 7” casing was set (11,121’ MD) and then cemented by
Schlumberger after which true lateral operations commenced.

Lateral Operations:

Leam provided equipment and personnel for MWD and directional drilling services. The
directional drillers and Sunburst geologists worked closely together throughout the project to
make steering decisions to maximize the amount of borehole exposure to pay zone for the lateral
section. At 11,121’ MD, a 6” bit, 1.50° mud motor and MWD tools comprised the first lateral
bottom-hole assembly (BHA). At 17,310’ MD the BHA was replaced due to problems during
sliding. The BHA was replaced and drilled efficiently to a total depth of 21,122’ MD, at a final
closure distance of 10,479.67’ with a closure direction of 181.5°. The bottom-hole location is:
10,476.07’ south and 274.56 west of surface location or 310.71’ FSL & 2,596.09’ FWL, SE SW
Section 24, T153N, R101W (Figure 4).

Generalized Stratigraphy and Zones of Interest:

The Kibbey Formation (Mississippian; Big Snowy Group) is a regressive sequence that
consists of a dark orange to red-brown siltstone with trace amounts of off white to light
gray anhydrite. Upper parts of the formation can contain porosity which can sometimes be
as high as 20 percent. The Kibbey “Lime” marker was encountered at 8,390’ (-6,272’),
and consists of a gray to gray-brown argillaceous lime mudstone with no visible porosity.

The Charles Formation (Mississippian; Madison Group) represents a highly variable
depositional environment, characterized by numerous and abrupt changes from restricted
hypersaline to open shallow water carbonate deposition. The Charles is an evaporite
dominated sequence characterized by interbedded halite, anhydrite, and intermittent beds of
light to medium gray slightly argillaceous limestone. Salts are represented by drastic
increases in the rate of penetration (ROP), anhydrite is characterized by sudden decrease in
ROP. The 1° Charles Salt was penetrated at 8,535’ TVD (-6,417’). Other salt beds were
encountered intermittently for the next 690 feet. The Base of the Last Salt (BLS) marker
bed was drilled at 9,226’ TVD (-7,207’). Below the BLS the Charles is characterized as a
light gray argillaceous limestone and dolo-mudstone, and represents the return to shallow
water, carbonate depositional environment which persisted for the next 50 feet. The
Ratcliffe interval was logged at 9,278’ TVD (-7,160’) and is described as a light gray
dolomite with interbedded anhydrite layers, followed by interbedded dolomitic and
argillaceous limestone. The lack of porosity and absence of hydrocarbons indicates this
interval has little prospect for future development.

The Mission Canyon Formation (Mississippian; Madison Group) was drilled at 9,458’ TVD (-
7,340’) and is comprised largely of light gray lime mudstone, followed by gray to tan earthy
textured argillaceous lime mudstone. Shows within the Mission Canyon ranged from 50 to 152
units against a 10.1 (ppg) mud weight.

The top of the Lodgepole Formation was logged at 10,012’ TVD (-7,894’). In general, the
Lodgepole can be described as a medium to dark gray-brown, argillaceous lime mudstone with
crystalline texture and trace amounts of disseminated pyrite (Figure 5). The False Bakken
(Carrington Shale), drilled at 10,718’ TVD (-8,600’), is comprised of very dark brown to black,
slightly pyritic & calcareous shale (Figure 6). Strong hydrocarbon shows in the lower 100’ of the
Lodgepole were as high as 80 total gas units, and suggests that some of the oil and gas from the
Bakken Formation may be exploiting fractures within the lower Lodgepole.


The Bakken Formation (Devonian — Mississippian) has four formal members, an upper and
lower black, fissile, organic-rich pyritic shale, separated by a clastic middle and lower member.
The Upper Bakken Shale was drilled at 10,727’ TVD (-8,609’) with sample returns typically
described as black, carbonaceous, petroliferous shale with trace amounts of disseminated pyrite
(Figure 7). The Middle Bakken, penetrated at 10,743’ TVD (-8,625’), consists of a varying
thickness and sequence of interbedded siltstone, limestone and silty sandstone. Common spotty
light brown oil staining was present along with gas shows as high as 611 units. Penetrated at
10,786’ TVD (-8,668’), the Lower Bakken Shale was described as a black to dark brown
carbonaceous shale with trace amounts of disseminated pyrite (Figure 8). Gas shows
encountered in the lower shale member read as high as 591 units (C1-C4). The Pronghorn was
penetrated at 10,798’ TVD (-8,680’) and is commonly described as a dark to medium gray,
calcite cemented siltstone.

The Three Forks Formation (Devonian; Kaskaskia Sequence), which represents a
regressive sequence deposited in a supratidal sabkha environment, was drilled at 10,811’
TVD (-8,693’) and is comprised of a light to medium gray, cream to off white sucrosic
dolomite with trace to occasional amounts of disseminated pyrite (Figure 10). The dolomite
is also silty and sandy in parts, and contains possible intercrystalline porosity with spotty
light brown oil staining. Another component of the Three Forks is a light gray-brown to
gray-green claystone overlain by an orange to pink and green dolomite. Shows within the
Three Forks Formation ranged from 93 to 911 units in a drilling mud weighing 9.7 (ppg).


Geo-steering:

Samples from the target zone varied in porosity, oil staining, color, cementation, and pyrite
content. Stratigraphic location in the target zone was based on these sample observations
along with gas shows, drill rates and gamma-ray values. Severe doglegs were to be avoided
to obtain the desired vertical section and aid in a successful completion liner run.

The Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC prospect geologist defined the target as a 15’
zone that began 12’ below the top of the Three Forks and ended four feet above the
claystone marker, 29’ below the top of the Three Forks. The target zone consisted of an
upper dolomite interval reading 75-50 (API) gamma counts (A marker). The center of the
target interval was comprised of an argillaceous dolomite reading 65-30 (API) gamma
counts (B marker). Underlying the argillaceous dolomite, in the center of the zone, was
another dolomite layer with gamma readings of 90-70 (API) counts (C marker). The A-C
gamma markers were used for determining depth within the target interval (Figure 11).

Horizontal drilling began 24’ below the Three Forks top. Just out of casing the well-bore
drilled just above the claystone, below the base of target (“C” marker). At 11,196’ MD the
bore was successfully turned up, and made its way back in to the target zone at 11,352’
MD. The well bore continued to rise up to the center of the target, near the “B” marker.
The well bore stayed directly above the center of the target for the next 400’ where it began
to fall down toward the base of target (“C” marker). Once again the well bore was turned
back up to the center of target where it stayed for the next 700’. At 13,180’ MD the well
rose toward the top of target (“A” marker), where it drilled until 14,602? MD. Downward
oriented slides soon, accompanied with a dip reversal, led to drilling out the bottom of the
zone (“C” marker) at 14,700’ MD. The well re-entered the target zone, at 15,485’ MD, and
began to rise up toward the center of the zone (“B” marker) where it drilled for the next
2,870’. The well then drilled towards the base of target (“C” marker) at 16,115’ MD, and
after 400’ re-entered the target (“B” marker) and stayed until total depth was called at
21,122’ MD.

TOTAL DRILLING DAYS: 19 days

CONTRACTOR: Nabors B25

Using the aforementioned information gathered during drilling, offset log information and
the structural data provided from Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC, well-site
geologists were able to anticipate, and interpret the local apparent dip during the drilling of
the Innoko 5301 43-12T well. A total depth of 21,122’ MD was reached on July 20, 2013 at
23:30 CT. The target resultant was 100% within the Three Forks Formation. The resulting
structure of the Three Forks Formation was a rise in TVD of 47.10’ over 10,020’, resulting
in an overall up-dip of 0.27° as portrayed on the Innoko 5301 43-12T profile (Figure 12).

Hydrocarbons:

Gas monitoring and fluid gains were monitored to evaluate the viability of this reservoir during
the Innoko 5301 43-12T well. In the invert mud system, hydrostatic conditions were maintained
near balance. This allowed for gas and fluid gains from the well to be monitored. The unit of
measure for gas on this well was units (u), which was defined as 100 units equaling 1% methane
equivalent in air.

Background gas observed during the lateral ranged from 20 to 600 units. Invert drilling fluid
was used throughout the drilling of the vertical and curve weighed 9.6-10.3 (ppg) and saline
drilling fluid was used during the lateral with a mud weight of 9.2-9.7 (ppg). Gas shows ranged
up to 911 units, and connection gases were observed up to 2,059 units. Gas components (C1-C4)
were observed throughout the course of the lateral. Trip gases were observed as high as 1,150
units (Figure 12).

Oil shows were very light throughout the lateral ranging from 0-3% in sample. It was observed
as a light brown spotty oil stain that yielded a slow to moderate streaming to diffuse light green
cut fluorescence.

SUMMARY

The Nabors B25 drilling rig successfully drilled a two-section, horizontal well-bore within the
Three Forks Formation at the Innoko 5301 43-12T. A net of 10,125’ was drilled within the
Three Forks. A mud program consisting of diesel invert (9.6-10.3 ppg) was used during the
vertical and curve build sections, and a saline based mud (9.2-9.7 ppg) was used during the
lateral which maintained stable-hole conditions and permitted adequate analysis of gas
concentrations.

Projections of dip were successfully used to maintain the well-bore in the Three Forks Formation
for 100% of the lateral. Samples from the target consisted of light to medium gray, cream to off
white, sucrosic dolomite. Intercrystalline porosity was generally seen throughout the target zone
during the entire lateral. Samples from the ideal zone contained a spotty light brown oil stain.
Hydrocarbon shows in the target zone were moderate throughout the lateral and stronger within
the targeted interval.

The Innoko 5301 43-12T will be fitted with a 4 %” production liner and swell packers in
preparation for a fracture stimulation that will determine the true commercial value of the well.
The well currently awaits fracture stimulation.

LITHOLOGY

Rig crews caught lagged samples in 30’ intervals under the supervision of Sunburst geologists. A detailed list of
sampling intervals is included in the well data summary page. Sample or gamma ray marker tops have been inserted
in the sample descriptions below for reference. Samples were examined wet and dry under a trinocular microscope.
The drilling fluid was diesel-based invert from surface casing to intermediate casing, while salt water drilling fluid
was used throughout the lateral. Sample collection began at 8,300’.

DETAILS OF WORK

Oasis Petroleum North America LLC requests permission for suspension of drilllng for up to 90 days for the
referenced well under NDAC 43-02-03-55. Oasis Petroleum North America LLC Intends to drill the surface hole with
freshwater based drilling mud and set surface casing with a small drilling rig and move off within 3 to § days. The
casing will be set at a depth pre-approved by the NDIC per the Application for Permit to Drill NDAC 43-02.03-21. No
saltwater will be used in the drilling and cementing operations of the surface casing. Once the surface casing is
cemented, a plug or mechanical! seal will be placed at the top of the casing to prevent any foreign matter from getting
into the well. A rig capable of drilling to TD will move onto the location within the 90 days previously outlined to
complete the drilling and casing plan as per the APD. The undersigned states that this request for suspension of
drilling operations in accordance with the Subsection 4 of Section 43-02-03-55 of the NDAC, is being requested to
take advantage of the cost savings and time savings of using an initial rig that Is smaller than the rig necessary to
drill a well to total depth but is not intended to alter or extend the terms and conditions of, or suspend any obligation
under, any oll and gas lease with acreage In or under the spacing or drilling unit for the above-referenced well. Oasis
Petroleum North America LLC understands NDAC 43-02-03-31 requirements regarding confidentiality pertaining to
this permit. The drilling pit will be fenced Immediately after construction If the well pad is located in a pasture (NDAC
43-02-03-19 & 19.1). Oasis Petroleum North America LL will plug and abandon the well and reclaim the well site If the
well is not drilled by the larger rotary rig within 90 days after spudding the well with the smaller drilling rig.

Permit Type: Development - HORIZONTAL
Field: BAKER Target Horizon: BAKKEN

Dear ROBIN E. HESKETH:

North Dakota Century Code (NDCC) Section 38-08-04 provides for the preservation of cores and samples and their
shipment to the State Geologist when requested. The following is required on the above referenced well:

1) All cores, core chips and samples must be submitted to the State Geologist as provided for the NDCC Section 38-
08-04 and North Dakota Administrative Code 43-02-03-38.1.

2) Samples shall include all cuttings from:

Base of the Last Charles Salt

Samples of cuttings shall be taken at 30' maximum intervals through all vertical, build and horizontal sections.
Samples must be washed, dried, packed in sample envelopes in correct order with labels showing operator, well
name, location and depth, and forwarded in standard boxes to the State Geologist within 30 days of the
completion of drilling operations.

3) Cores: ALL CORES cut shall be preserved in correct order, properly boxed, and forwarded to the State Geologist
within 90 days of completion of drilling operations. Any extension of time must have written approval from the
State Geologist.

4) All cores, core chips, and samples must be shipped, prepaid, to the State Geologist at the following address:

ND Geological Survey Core Library
Campus Road and Cornell
Grand Forks, ND 58202

5) NDCC Section 38-08-16 allows for a civil penalty for any violation of Chapter 38 08 not to exceed $12,500 for

Survey Requirements for Horizontal, Horizontal Re-entry, and Directional Wells

NDAC Section 43-02-03-25 (Deviation Tests and Directional Surveys) states in part (that) the survey contractor
shall file a certified copy of all surveys with the director free of charge within thirty days of completion. Surveys
must be submitted as one electronic copy, or in a form approved by the director. However, the director may
require the directional survey to be filed immediately after completion if the survey is needed to conduct the
operation of the director's office in a timely manner. Certified surveys must be submitted via email in one adobe
document, with a certification cover page to certsurvey@nd.gov.

Survey points shall be of such frequency to accurately determine the entire location of the well bore.

Reserve pit
Please be advised that conditions may be imposed on the use and reclamation of a drilling reserve pit on
this site if specific site conditions warrant.

Surface casing cement

Tail cement utilized on surface casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi within 12
hours, and tail cement utilized on production casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi
before drilling the plug or initiating tests.

Logs

NDAC Section 43-02-03-31 requires the running of a Cement Bond Log from which the presence of
cement can be determined in every well in which production or intermediate casing has been set and a Gamma
Ray Log must be run from total depth to ground level elevation of the well bore. All logs must be submitted as
one paper copy and one digital copy in LAS (Log ASCII) format, or a format approved by the Director. Image
logs that include, but are not limited to, Mud Logs, Cement Bond Logs, and Cyberlook Logs, cannot be produced
in their entirety as LAS (Log ASCI)) files. To create a solution and establish a standard format for industry to
follow when submitting image logs, the Director has given approval for the operator to submit an image log as a
TIFF (*.tif) formatted file. The TIFF (*.tif) format will be accepted only when the log cannot be produced in its
entirety as a LAS (Log ASCII) file format. The digital copy may be submitted on a 3.5” floppy diskette, a standard
CD, or attached to an email sent to digitallogs@nd.gov
Thank you for your cooperation.

Sincerely,

David Tabor

RE: HORIZONTAL WELL
TIMMONS 5301 43-12B
SWSE Section 12-153N-101W
McKenzie County
Well File # 22221
Dear Kaitlin:

Pursuant to Commission Order No. 18012, approval to drill the above captioned well is hereby given. The
approval is granted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than
the 200' setback from the north & south boundaries and 500' setback from the east & west boundaries within
the 1280 acre spacing unit consisting of Sections 12 & 1-T153N-R101W.

PERMIT STIPULATIONS: OASIS PETRO NO AMER must contact NDIC Field Inspector Marc
Binns at 701-220-5989 prior to location construction. A CLOSED MUD SYSTEM IS REQUIRED ON
MULTI-WELL PADS, ALTHOUGH THE DISPOSAL OF DRILL CUTTINGS IS CONTINGENT
UPON SITE SPECIFIC CONDITIONS TO BE DETERMINED BY AN NDIC FIELD
INSPECTOR.

Form 1 Changes & Hard Lines

Any changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC.
The proposed directional plan is at a legal location. The minimum legal coordinates from the well head at casing
point is: 50’S & 2010’ E. Also, based on the azimuth of the proposed lateral the maximum legal coordinates from
the well head is: 2010’ E & 10054’ N.

Location Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period)

Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the
approved drilling permit on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report. If circumstances require operations to
commence before the 3rd business day following publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may
be waived by the Director. Application for a waiver must be by sworn affidavit providing the information
necessary to evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(, and any other
information that would allow the Director to conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the
drilling permit, the applicant should retain the permit.

Permit Fee & Notification

Payment was received in the amount of $100 via credit card .The permit fee has been received. It is requested
that notification be given immediately upon the spudding of the well. This information should be relayed to the

NOTE: A Gamma Ray log must be run to ground surface and a CBL must be run on intermediate or longstring casing string if set.

Surveys are required at least every 30 feet in the build section and every 90 feet in the lateral section of a horizontal well. Measurement
inaccuracies are not considered when determining compliance with the spacing/drilling unit boundary setback requirement except in the
following scenarios: 1) When the angle between the well bore and the respective boundary is 10 degrees or less; or 2) If Industry standard
methods and equipment are not utilized. Consult the applicable field order for exceptions.

If measurement inaccuracies are required to be considered, a 2° MWD measurement inaccuracy will be applied to the horizontal portion of the well
bore. This measurement inaccuracy is applied to the well bore from KOP to TD.

REQUIRED ATTACHMENTS: Certified surveyor's plat, horizontal section plat, estimated geological tops, proposed mud/cementing plan,
directional plot/plan, $100 fee.
