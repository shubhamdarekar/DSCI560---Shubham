STRIPPER WELL DETERMINATION

Dear Mr. Travis:

Oasis Petroleum North America LLC (Oasis) filed with the North Dakota Industrial Commission
— Oil and Gas Division (Commission) on November 19, 2019 an application for a Stripper Well
Determination for the above captioned well.

Information contained in the application indicates that the above mentioned well is a stripper
well pursuant to statute and rule, and Oasis has elected to designate said well as a stripper well.
The well produced from a well depth greater than 10000 feet and was completed after June 30,
2013. During the qualifying period, February 1, 2018 through January 31, 2019, the well
produced at a maximum efficient rate or was not capable of exceeding the production threshold.
The average daily production from the well was 32.8 barrels of oil per day during this period.

It is therefore determined that the above captioned well qualifies as a “Stripper Well” pursuant to
Section 57-51.1-01 of the North Dakota Century Code. This determination is applicable only to
the Bakken Pool in and under said well.

The Commission shall have continuing jurisdiction, and shall have the authority to review the
matter, and to amend or rescind the determination if such action is supported by additional or
newly discovered information. If you have any questions, do not hesitate to contact me.

Sincerely,
Daid’J. McCusker

Figure 1. Xtreme 21 at the Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC Kline Federal 5300 11-18 2B
well during June of 2015 in McKenzie County, North Dakota.

INTRODUCTION

The Oasis Petroleum, North America LLC, Kline Federal 5300 11-18 2B well is located
approximately 4 miles south of Williston in McKenzie County, North Dakota [Lot 1 Section
18, T153N, RIOOW]. The Kline Federal 5300 11-18 2B is a horizontal, Middle Bakken
Member well drilled by Xtreme rig #21 (Figure 1). The lateral section consists of one west to
east trending, 9,932’ long wellbore penetrating underneath Lake Sakakawea. The surface,
vertical and curve sections were previously drilled, and this evaluation will consist of primarily
operations and observations made during the lateral section.

ENGINEERING

The Kline Federal 5300 11-18 2B surface, vertical and curve sections were drilled earlier in
2015 by separate drilling rig. Xtreme 21 returned to location in May of 2015 to drill the laterals
of the Kline Federal 5300 11-18 2B, 3T, 2B, and re-entered the Kline Federal 5300 11-18 2B
on May 30, 2015.

SUMMARY

The Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC, Kline Federal 5300 11-18 2B lateral section was
drilled by Xtreme 21, from re-entry to total depth, in 7 days. The well reached a total depth of
20,450' MD on June 6, 2015. Geologic data, hydrocarbon gas measurements, and sample
examination indicate an encouraging Middle Bakken Member well. Multiple sections of
higher gas were recorded through the lateral section. Positive connection and survey shows,
exceeding 1,000 units, were recorded throughout the lateral. Samples from the target zone
consisted of light brown to off white, silty sandstone and yielded a moderate, pale yellow,
streaming cut fluorescence and poor to fair intergranular porosity. The well was within the
targeted zone for 67% of the lateral and exposed 9,568' of potentially productive Middle
Bakken Member to the well bore. The well currently awaits completion operations.

Ryan O’Dowmnell

Well Site Geologist
Sunburst Consulting, Inc.
June 6, 2015

Drilling began with a 6” Halliburton PDC bit, Ryan Directional Services MWD tools, and 1.5°
adjustable Baker Hughes mud motor. This assembly drilled to 15,484’ MD where a trip was
made due to low penetration rates. Another complete assembly drilled to 17,597’ MD, where
at 23:30 CDT on June 2, 2015 the wellbore made contact with the upper Bakken shale at
17,540’ MD, 10,766’ TVD (-8,698’). A sidetrack was initiated at 17,420’ MD, using the same
assembly, and successfully kicked off. After the sidetrack, drilling continued to 20,149’ MD
where another trip was made due to slowing penetration rates. A new motor was picked up
and the well later reached its total depth at 20,450' MD, at 08:45 CDT on June 6, 2015,
generating an exposure of 9,568’ linear feet of 6” hole through the Middle Bakken Member.
The bottom hole location lies 111.86’ south & 9,932.10' east of surface location or
approximately 1,071.86' FNL & 296.01’ FEL, NE NE Section 17, T153N, R100W.

GEOLOGY
Lithology

Sunburst Geology, Inc. was not present for the vertical and curve sections, therefore no
lithology is discussed prior to the Middle Bakken Member.

Middle Bakken Member

The Middle Bakken Member was penetrated at 10,882’ MD, 10,727’ TVD (-8,659’). The
middle member in this locality is generally composed of a light gray-brown to light gray, very
fine to fine grained, moderately to well cemented, calcite cemented silty sandstone. It was
apparent that samples observed higher in the member were often light brown, off white to
cream colored, while the lower portion of the member was predominantly darker, gray-brown.
Throughout the lateral, trace amounts of both disseminated and nodular pyrite were observed.
Samples also displayed trace, poor to fair intergranular porosity and trace spotty and
occasionally even, light brown oil staining (Figure 2).

Figure 2. Middle Bakken silty sandstone, observed in the upper portion of the target interval.

Geosteering

The potential pay zone for the Kline Federal 5300 11-18 2B was identified by evaluating
gamma data collected while drilling the Oasis Petroleum, Kline Federal 5300 41-18 11 T2,
and the steering practices from the Oasis Petroleum, Kline Federal 5300 11-18 5B. The target
was determined to be 12’ thick, and located 12’ below the Upper Bakken Shale and 20’ above
the Lower Bakken Shale. The Middle Bakken Member displayed gamma counts ranging from
70 to 140 (API). The target was identified by having a higher gamma marker at the very top of
target, moderate markers throughout the target zone and a cool marker at the base (Figure 3).
Despite a single, upper shale strike, geologists were successful in exposing 9,568' of potentially
productive Middle Bakken Member the well bore. The well was within the targeted zone for
67% of the lateral.

Shale Strike Summary

At measured depths 16,750’ through 16,820’, erratic high gamma counts were logged. This
high count anomaly was interpreted as being the warm gamma associated with being near the
top of target. Given the well bore was descending at inclinations ranging from 88.9° to 88.2°
(16,750’ through 16,820’), it was anticipated that this higher gamma would repeat as the well
bore leveled off or slowly rose in zone. As the wells descent was controlled and the inclination
raised above 90° (~17,050’ MD), the dip profile displayed the well bore being ~3’ from the top
of target (13.5’ from base of UBS). From this point forward the well bore slowly rose in
section and geologists did not see any great concern with the well bore position, given that we
had yet to see any warm gamma signatures associated with the top of target. In addition, a
majority of the wells within this two-section corridor, drilling east, had a synclinal feature after
the halfway point of the lateral. Between the surveys at 17,395’ and 17,489’ MD, the
inclination increased from 89.9° to 91.7°. While sliding down to correct the ascending
inclination gamma counts rose. It was at this time that decision to stop and circulate a bottoms-
up was made. Samples from the bottoms up confirmed the Upper Bakken Shale had been
contacted.

Gas and Oil Shows

Hydrocarbon shows at the beginning of the lateral were relatively low. During the first ~1,500’
of lateral operations the well bore remained primarily near the base if not below the target
zone. While drilling this interval background gasses rarely exceeded 1,000 units, but
connection, survey and slide gasses regularly exceeded 1,000 units. Oil show throughout this
period of drilling was moderate, with most cuttings reacting slowly with a pale yellow diffuse
cut fluorescence. As the well bore reached the top of the target interval hydrocarbon shows
increased. These brief periods of higher gas shows occurred three times while drilling along
the upper portion of the target zone (12,250’- 12,510’ MD, 13,200’-13,950’ MD, and 16,300’-
16,430’ MD) (Figure 4). Although these optimistic shows were intermittent, samples
displayed a more promising oil staining that that observed in lower samples. Samples along
the upper portion displayed a light to medium brown even oil staining. Fluorescent cuts were
also slightly more promising than those observed lower in zone were. Cuts were described as:
moderate, pale yellow, streaming cut fluorescence. While drilling from 11,510’ to 11,656’ MD
there were issues with the gas detection, this caused low gas readings. When the system was
repaired, gas shows immediately climbed. For the remainder of the well, despite of the well
being high or low in zone, background gasses were low (400-1,200 units), while connection
gasses occasionally exceeded 1,300 units. Unfortunately, due to heavy contamination from
lubricants there were no cuts performed after 14,950’ MD. Although hydrocarbon shows
remained consistent despite of position within the target zone, the most promising oil stainin
remained in the upper most portion of the target interval.

LITHOLOGY

Rig crews caught lagged samples in 50’ intervals under the supervision of a Sunburst geologist. A detailed
list of sampling intervals is included in the well data summary page. Samples were examined wet and dry
conditions under a binocular microscope and checked for hydrocarbon cut fluorescence with Entron. Sample
descriptions began at re-entry point within the Middle Bakken Member. The drilling fluid was salt water
solution in the lateral.

Subject: SOD sundries for the Kline Federal 5300 11-18 pad
Attachments: Kline Federal 11-18 SOD sundries.pdf; ATTOO001.txt
Importance: High

Good Evening Todd,

Per our conversation | have attached the SOD sundries for the 3 wells on the Kline pad. A few key points:

1) We will move the rig to the Carson SWD pad once we have finished drilling the vertical portions of all 3 wells on
this pad.

2) We will finish drilling the vertical portion of the third well, the Kline Federal 5300 11-18 2B, on April 9".

3) We will utilize a 2" rig to drill the lateral portions of the 3 wells on this pad.

4) The 2™ rig is currently drilling wells on a different pad and is scheduled to reach TD on the final well in late
May/early June, leaving a gap of approximately 55 days.

5) We will be able to return to the Kline Federal 5300 11-18 pad on or before June 6".

Given the time sensitive nature of this request, expedited review of these sundries would be greatly appreciated.
Thank you for your consideration,

Survey Requirements for Horizontal, Horizontal Re-entry, and Directional Wells

NDAC Section 43-02-03-25 (Deviation Tests and Directional Surveys) states in part (that) the survey contractor
shall file a certified copy of all surveys with the director free of charge within thirty days of completion. Surveys
must be submitted as one electronic copy, or in a form approved by the director. However, the director may
require the directional survey to be filed immediately after completion if the survey is needed to conduct the
operation of the director's office in a timely manner. Certified surveys must be submitted via email in one adobe
document, with a certification cover page to certsurvey@nd.gov.
Survey points shall be of such frequency to accurately determine the entire location of the well bore.

Tail cement utilized on surface casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi within 12
hours, and tail cement utilized on production casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi
before drilling the plug or initiating tests.

Logs

NDAC Section 43-02-03-31 requires the running of (1) a suite of open hole logs from which formation tops and
porosity zones can be determined, (2) a Gamma Ray Log run from total depth to ground level elevation of the well bore, and
(3) a log from which the presence and quality of cement can be determined (Standard CBL or Ultrasonic cement evaluation
log) in every well in which production or intermediate casing has been set, this log must be run prior to completing the well.

LOT1 Section 18-153N-100W
McKenzie County
Well File # 29334
Dear Heather:

Pursuant to Commission Order No. 23752, approval to drill the above captioned well is hereby given. The
approval is granted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than
the 500' setback from the north & south boundaries and 200' setback from the east & west boundaries within
the 1280 acre spacing unit consisting of Sections 18 & 17, T153N R100W.

PERMIT STIPULATIONS: Effective June 1, 2014, a covered leak-proof container (with placard) for
filter sock disposal must be maintained on the well site beginning when the well is spud, and must
remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations are
conducted. In addition, OASIS PETROLEUM NORTH AMERICA LLC must take into consideration
NDAC 43-02-03-28 (Safety Regulation) when contemplating simultaneous operations on the above
captioned location. Pursuant to NDAC 43-02-03-28 (Safety Regulation) “No boiler, portable electric
lighting generator, or treater shall be placed nearer than 150 feet to any producing well or oil tank.”
Lastly, OASIS PETROLIUM NORTH AMERICA LLC must contact NDIC Field Inspector Richard
Dunn at 701-770-3554 prior to location construction.

Drilling pit

NDAC 43-02-03-19.4 states that “a pit may be utilized to bury drill cuttings and solids generated during well
drilling and completion operations, providing the pit can be constructed, used and reclaimed in a manner that will
prevent pollution of the land surface and freshwaters. Reserve and circulation of mud system through earthen pits
are prohibited. All pits shall be inspected by an authorized representative of the director prior to lining and use.
Drill cuttings and solids must be stabilized in a manner approved by the director prior to placement in a cuttings

pit.”

Form 1 Changes & Hard Lines

Any changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC.
The proposed directional plan is at a legal location. Based on the azimuth of the proposed lateral the maximum
legal coordinate from the well head is: 10028’ E.

Location Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period)

Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the
approved drilling permit on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report. If circumstances require operations to
commence before the 3rd business day following publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may
be waived by the Director. Application for a waiver must be by sworn affidavit providing the information
necessary to evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f, and any other
information that would allow the Director to conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the
drilling permit, the applicant should retain the permit.

DETAILS OF WORK

Oasis Petroleum North America LLC requests permission for suspension of drilling for up to 90 days for the
referenced well under NDAC 43-02-03-55. Oasis Petroleum North America LLC intends to drill the surface hole with
freshwater based drilling mud and set surface casing with a small drilling rig and move off within 3 to 5 days. The
casing will be set at a depth pre-approved by the NDIC per the Application for Permit to Drill NDAC 43-02-03-21. No
saltwater will be used in the drilling and cementing operations of the surface casing. Once the surface casing is
cemented, a plug or mechanical seal will be placed at the top of the casing to prevent any foreign matter from getting
into the well. A rig capable of drilling to TD will move onto the location within the 90 days previously outlined to
complete the drilling and casing plan as per the APD. The undersigned states that this request for suspension of
drilling operations in accordance with the Subsection 4 of Section 43-02-03-55 of the NDAC, is being requested to
take advantage of the cost savings and time savings of using an initial rig that is smaller than the rig necessary to
drill a well to total depth but is not intended to alter or extend the terms and conditions of, or suspend any obligation
under, any oil and gas lease with acreage in or under the spacing or drilling unit for the above-referenced well. Oasis
Petroleum North America LLC understands NDAC 43-02-03-31 requirements regarding confidentiality pertaining to
this permit. The drilling pit will be fenced immediately after construction if the well pad is located in a pasture (NDAC
43-02-03-19 & 19.1). Oasis Petroleum North America LL will plug and abandon the well and reclaim the well site if the
well is not drilled by the larger rotary rig within 90 days after spudding the well with the smaller drilling rig.

inaccuracies are not considered when determining compliance with the spacing/drilling unit boundary setback requirement except in the
following scenarios: 1) When the angle between the well bore and the respective boundary is 10 degrees or less; or 2) If Industry standard
methods and equipment are not utilized. Consult the applicable field order for exceptions.

If measurement inaccuracies are required to be considered, a 2° MWD measurement inaccuracy will be applied to the horizontal portion of the well
bore. This measurement inaccuracy is applied to the well bore from KOP to TD.

REQUIRED ATTACHMENTS: Certified surveyor's plat, horizontal section plat, estimated geological tops, proposed mud/cementing plan,

directional plot/plan, $100 fee.

RE: Filter Socks and Other Filter Media
Leakproof Container Required
Oil and Gas Wells

Dear Operator,

North Dakota Administrative Code Section 43-02-03-19.2 states in part that all waste material associated with
exploration or production of oil and gas must be properly disposed of in an authorized facility in accord with all
applicable local, state, and federal laws and regulations.

Filtration systems are commonly used during oil and gas operations in North Dakota. The Commission is very
concerned about the proper disposal of used filters (including filter socks) used by the oil and gas industry.

Effective June 1, 2014, a container must be maintained on each well drilled in North Dakota beginning when the
well is spud and must remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations
are conducted. The on-site container must be used to store filters until they can be properly disposed of in an
authorized facility. Such containers must be:

e leakproof to prevent any fluids from escaping the container

e covered to prevent precipitation from entering the container

e placard to indicate only filters are to be placed in the container

If the operator will not utilize a filtration system, a waiver to the container requirement will be considered, but
only upon the operator submitting a Sundry Notice (Form 4) justifying their request.

As previously stated in our March 13, 2014 letter, North Dakota Administrative Code Section 33-20-02.1-01
states in part that every person who transports solid waste (which includes oil and gas exploration and production
wastes) is required to have a valid permit issued by the North Dakota Department of Health, Division of Waste
Management. Please contact the Division of Waste Management at (701) 328-5166 with any questions on the
solid waste program. Note oil and gas exploration and production wastes include produced water, drilling mud,
invert mud, tank bottom sediment, pipe scale, filters, and fly ash.

Thank you for your cooperation.

Sincerely,

Brace E. Fichs
