County, North Dakota.

Introduction

The Oasis Petroleum NA, LLC. Lewis Federal 5300 11-31 4BR is located in Baker Field of the Williston
Basin [Lot 1 Section 31, T153N, R1O0W]. The subject well is located approximately 8 miles south of the
town of Williston, in McKenzie County, North Dakota (Figure 1). The Lewis Federal 5300 11-31 4BR is
the fourth of four wells drilled on the Lewis Federal 5300 11-31 pad. The subject well was drilled to replace
the Lewis Federal 5300 11-31 4B, which had drilled to kick off point before being plugged and abandoned.
This pad is set up as a 1,280 acre laydown spacing unit, with 500’ N/S and 150’ E/W drilling setbacks. The
subject well is permitted to drill east from the surface location in section 31 into section 32. The well
consists of a single Middle Bakken Member lateral, targeting a silty sandstone facies, with intent to intersect
preferred porosity and fractures.

A GEOLOGY SERVICE


Engineering Operations Overview

The Lewis Federal 5300 11-31 4BR was spud on February 18, 2019. The surface hole was drilled with one
17.5” assembly to a depth of 3,629’. The complete BHA accomplishments can be found in an appendix to
this report. The 13 3/8” surface casing was set to a depth of 3,598’. Due to the presence of several salt water
disposal wells in the immediate area the decision was made to set a 9 5/8” isolation casing string through
the Inyan Kara and into the Swift. The isolation portion was drilled with two 12 %4” assemblies. The 9 5/8”
casing was then set to set to a depth of 6,142’. The remainder of the vertical hole was completed with two
8.75” assemblies. The first vertical assembly drilled to a depth of 8,609’ before being replace due to low
ROP, the second drilled to a depth of 10,301’ (KOP).

The curve assembly consisted of an 8.75” Baker DDSOS5TS PDC bit, a 2.38° NOV mud motor, and
Scientific Drilling’s MWD tools. The curve was successfully landed at 11,170’ MD on March 3, 2019. The
projection to bit upon reaching casing point was that the assembly had an inclination of 91° and was at a
TVD of 10,773’, approximately 16’ below the Upper Bakken Shale. Seven inch diameter 32# P-110
intermediate casing was set to 11,155’ MD at landing. As the first lateral assembly drilled out of casing it
was realized that the inclination in which casing was set was much less than had been projected. The first
survey read an inclination of 78.21°. Projecting to the bit this placed the wellbore ~2’ from the top of the
Lower Bakken Shale. After confirming that the 78.21° was correct the decision was made to trip out and
pick up a higher bend motor and displace the salt water drilling fluid with oil-based mud and slide drill
ahead through the Lower Shale and return to the Middle Bakken. This resulted in 144’ on Lower Bakken
Shale exposure.

Due to the heavy (10.8 ppg) invert mud weight drill rates were substantially slower than the previous wells
on the Lewis Federal 11-31 pad. The second lateral assembly drilled to a depth of 16,577’ before a trip was
required due to low ROP. While tripping in with the third lateral assembly, tight hole conditions were
experienced at the Lower Bakken Shale contact. As the assembly was washing through the shale the BHA
was oriented to the high side. The assembly washed through to a depth of 11,456’ before stopping due to
the rising MWD continuous inclination (98.53°). Since this inclination was ~5° higher than the surveys
observed while drilling on March 7, it was postulated the assembly had unintentionally sidetracked while
washing through the shale. This new wellbore was titled Sidetrack #1 and can be found in the surveys
appendix of this report. The decision was made to set a cement plug at the intermediate casing shoe,
sidetrack off the plug and proceed with a new lateral, titled Sidetrack #2.

Sidetrack#2 was drilled off the cement plug of the original wellbore at 11,152’ on March 15, 2019. It drilled
to a depth of 16,014’ and was terminated in the Upper Bakken Shale on March 20, 2019. At this time the
integrity of the survey data and calculated true vertical depths came into question due to corresponding
depths of the previous wellbores that had been drilled on the pad. Several surveys were reshot throughout
the sidetrack which resulted in inclination and azimuth swings of no more than 0.20 degrees.

Sidetrack #3 was initiated at 14,990’ on March 21, 2019 and was drilled off of Sidetrack #2. Sidetrack #3
was terminated in the Upper Bakken Shale at a measured depth of 15,669’ on March 22, 2019, 15’ of TVD
above Sidetrack #2, resulting in a formation dip of 87.31°. The decision to drill an additional sidetrack in
effort to complete the lateral was made.

Sidetrack #4 was drilled was drilled off of Sidetrack #2, it was initiated at 14,500’ on March 22, 2019.
Sidetrack #4 was terminated in the Lower Bakken Shale on March 24, 2019, at 17,079’. An additional
sidetrack was planned at this time. Sidetrack # 5 was drilled off of Sidetrack #4 at 16,825’, it drilled to a
depth of 16,834’ at which point it was abandoned by order of Oasis Petroleum, and a new sidetrack point
was picked.

Sidetrack #6 was drilled off of Sidetrack #4 at 16,235’ on March 26, 2019. The first lateral assembly of
Sidetrack #6 drilled to a depth of 20,195’ before a trip was warranted due to an MWD failure. The final
lateral assembly reached a total depth of 20,780’ on March 29, 2019, without further incident.

Thirteen six-inch lateral assemblies were used on this wellbore, which included tri-cones, sidetrack bits,
and PDC’s, along with 1.5° and 2.25° motors. The last lateral assembly being bit #15RR2, a Reed PDC
TKCS53 with a 1.5° fixed Discovery motor. A total depth of 20,780’ was reached at 20:45 hours, central
time, on March 29, 2019.

Offset Control

Offset well data can be found in the ‘Control Data’ section appended to this report. Offset wells were
essential in providing control, making it possible to develop a prognosis of formation tops and curve landing
target depth. The three primary offsets were, The Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC, Lewis Federal
5300 11-31 3B, the Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC, Lewis Federal 5300 11-31 2B, and the Oasis
Petroleum North America, LLC, Wade Federal 5300 41-30 8T3. By referencing the gamma signature of
these offsets and using formation thicknesses, a model was formed for the target interval pinpointing a
strategic landing. Formation thicknesses expressed by gamma ray signatures in these offset wells were
compared to gamma data collected during drilling operations in to successfully land the curve.

Geology

Sample evaluation began in the Otter Formation at 8,260’ measured depth (MD). Lagged samples were
caught by Sunburst personnel in 30’ intervals through the vertical and curve, and 50’ intervals in the lateral.
Rock samples were evaluated under wet and dry conditions using a stereo zoom binocular microscope for
the identification of lithology including the presence of porosity and oil. Only observed prospective intervals
are described here, but detailed lithological descriptions for all formations are provided in the “Lithology’
appendix.

The Mission Canyon Formation [Mississippian, Madison Group]
was logged at 9,510' MD, 9,448’ TVD (-7,313' MSL). The Mission
Canyon Formation is described as light to medium gray, cream, and
light brown gray in color. Samples are predominately microcrystalline
and are a firm mudstone. The limestone has an earthy, rarely
crystalline texture. Also noted in in several samples are traces of
fossil fragments. The lime mudstone is argillaceous in part throughout
this interval. In certain areas poor intercrystalline was noted but there
was no significant oil staining observed in samples. Throughout the
Mission Canyon gas shows are promising, but slightly less than two
previous wells on this pad, with an average background gasses ~31lu
with gas shows peaking at 77u.

The Bakken Formation

The Upper Bakken Shale Member [Mississippian] was recorded at 10,987' MD, 10,741’ TVD (-8,606'
MSL). Entry into this member is characterized by high gamma counts (>300 APD), elevated background
gas and increased rates of penetration. While drilling through the Upper Bakken Shale gas a background
gas of 800u was observed, as well as a survey gas of 1917u. The distinct black shale is carbonaceous and
petroliferous, as well as, firm and platy. Minerals including disseminated/nodular pyrite and trace calcite
fracture fill were observed.

The Middle Bakken Member [Mississippian-Devonian] was entered
at 11,038’ MD, 10,757' TVD (-8,622' MSL). Samples in the Middle
Bakken are predominantly a light brown, medium to light gray, light
brown gray, and occasionally cream silty sandstone. The silty
sandstone is fine to very fine grained, friable to occasionally firm. The
Middle Bakken typically contains sub-round to sub-angular grains.
Samples are smooth, moderately sorted and poorly cemented by
calcite. Rare to trace quantities of disseminated and nodular pyrite is
present as is trace to fair intergranular porosity. Trace to rare light-
medium brown, spotty oil stain was visible in many of these samples.
While drilling the Middle Bakken background gasses ranged from
~200 to 3,000 units while several shows exceeded 3500u. Upon
starting sidetrack#4 at 14,500’ the gas buster was turned on, gases
averaged 1,000 to 3,000 units after that point.

Geosteering

Well control insinuated the structure of the Lewis Federal 7 LEWIS 4BR TRACEBACK
11-31 4BR would be a consistent down dip over the course
of the lateral. Oasis operations geologists provided casing
point slides prior to drill out, with Upper Bakken structure
maps, in which they anticipated the structure to be down
at 89.55° for the first 4,000’ of vertical section, then
steepen to 89.20° to 6,000’ of vertical section, followed by
89.50° for the remainder of the lateral to completion. It was
also suggested that the structure would be much like that
of the first and closest lateral drilled on the pad, the Lewis
Federal 5300 11-31 3B.

While drilling the curve of the Lewis Federal 5300 11-31
4BR the Lower Bakken Shale was contacted. Due to the
lower than anticipated build rates through the curve, it was
possible to use the gamma signatures throughout the
middle member as a type log. Upon exiting the cement
plug of Sidetrack #2 and coming down into target, it
became apparent that the gamma signature was very
similar to the initial curve landing and was the best
reference to use as a control. The Middle Bakken Member
of the Lewis Federal 5300 11-31 4BR was 39’ from shale
to shale. Whereas when drilling the Lewis Federal 5300
11-31 3B, a thinner Middle Bakken model of 36’ was used.

Figure 4. Target definition for the Oasis Petroleum, Lewis Federal
5300 11-31 4BR.

The target interval was defined by proximity to the shales and not by an ideal porosity interval. The 20’
target began 10’ below the Upper Bakken Shale and extended to 9’ above the Lower Bakken Shale. Prior
to drilling out Sidetrack#2, it was determined by the initial drilling of Sidetrack#1, that the warmer chattery
gamma located at 13’ TVT through 16’ TVT was going to be the most consistent steering guide in
recognizing the upper portion of target. The non-descript, featureless gamma of 26’ TVT to 30’ TVT would

, ?

be the best indicator of being in the lower portion of target (Figure 4). The cool gamma markers located at
7 TVT and 36’ TVT would be predications of close shale proximity and should not be approached as to
make steering decision, but only be used as a last-ditch effort to pull a stop card, avoiding any shale strikes.

As drilling began into Sidetrack #2 it became apparent that subtle changes in gamma signature were hard
to distinguish from one another. Average gamma counts of 44 api, with a maximum of 56 api, were present
throughout target. The coolest gamma counts witnessed were 26-29 api, which was attributed to the marker
just below target center at 23’ TVT or the gamma Marker out target top at 77 TVT. With such a minuscule
change in gamma signature it was possible to misinterpret one portion of target for another. The notion of
targeting 13-16’ TVT was possible, however, it was easily mistaken for the gamma near 21-26’ TVT. The
gamma signature as well as the exact count were near identical when exiting the top of target and the bottom
of target. It is also worth mentioning that when the wellbore is being drilled at or near formation dip, gamma
signature does not change, and can be easily misinterpreted as moving through either of these sections.

While drilling Sidetrack #2 several interpretations varying by 17’ TVT in both directions, plausibly overlaid
the gamma of the type log. As a result, best practices suggested to use the interpretation that most closely
placed the wellbore near the TVD of the first wellbore, the Lewis Federal 5300 11-314BR, since the lateral
was Safely drilled to 16,577’ MD (5,935.68’ VS) without contacting the shale. As Sidetrack #2 was drilled
ahead, projected target TVDs were set, that most closely matched the target TVDs of the original wellbore,
as well as using the most plausible interpretations of gamma overlay to match. At an approximate measured
depth 15,947’ (~5,302’ VS) and TVD of 10,825.88’ the shale was contacted solely based on drilling
parameters (lost weight on bit, increased rate of penetration). The driller continued drilling ahead to 16,014’,
when drilling parameters did not return to normal, and gamma visibly heated up, at which point he was
instructed to pull off bottom. Bottoms up was circulated and shale was confirmed in the sample. The
previous wellbore had been drilled within half a foot of TVD at this exact vertical section. Due to this it
was thought that surveys were bad, and a gyro truck was called. Prior to the gyro truck’s arrival Oasis had
the rig trip out, re-shooting several surveys along the way. When the survey data came back with no less
than 0.20° swings in azimuth or inclination, the decision was made not to drop a gyro and the truck was
called off.

Two viable interpretations using gamma signature upon entering the shale could be done, placing the
wellbore in the lower or upper shale. Unable to get a solid confirmation through sample cuttings or gamma
overlay both scenarios were inspected closer. An Upper Bakken Shale strike scenario calculated a -0.80°
dip from Upper Bakken Shale at curve landing to the shale strike. Whereas a lower shale strike calculation
from Lower Bakken Shale at landing to shale strike produced a -0.35° dip calculation. The average dip of
the first lateral from target entry to termination was exactly -0.80°. When the survey data of all re-shot
surveys was imported it showed the TVD moving upward with each edit. Though unreliable, Directional
Drillers plotted the continuous inclinations which also showed a substantial rise in TVD. It should be noted
that not one of these tools could indicate the exact shale that was entered with 100% certainty alone.
However, using all the information at hand Sunburst personnel came to the solid conclusion that the Shale
strike was in fact an Upper Bakken Shale strike. The Oasis Operations Geologist was contacted by Sunburst
in which valid concerns were made of an Upper Bakken Shale strike, and each piece of evidence voiced in
favor of the Upper versus the Lower Shale, it was also stated how detrimental the conclusion was prior to
drilling out the next sidetrack. Sunburst was informed that the Oasis Geologist’s as a whole concluded that
it was a Lower Bakken Shale strike and to proceed ahead using that interpretation.

Sidetrack #3 was then initiated at 14,990’ under Oasis’s assumption that the previous sidetrack struck the
Lower Bakken Shale and therefore was drilled above Sidetrack #2. While drilling ahead a cool gamma
Marker of 27 api was encountered at 15,460’ which was the marker at 7’ TVT, 7’ from the Upper Bakken
Shale. At 15,622’ while sliding 90° left to veer Sidetrack #3 away from the existing sidetrack rates of
penetration increased from 2.7 minutes a foot to one minute per foot. It was at this time the shale was

assumed to be entered near a TVD of 10,811’. The driller drilled to 15,669’ feet before being instructed to
pull of bottom. A bottoms up was circulated and shale was confirmed in the sample. The two shale strikes
resulted in a dip calculation of approximately -2.69°. This abrupt drop in formation was not expected nor
seen on both of the wells drilled on the pad. At this point Oasis geologists, onsite Sunburst Geology, and
Sunburst’s remote steering center all did completely separate interpretations of both shale strikes. The
consensus of Sunburst geology, both onsite and remote, was that both shale strikes took place in the Upper
Bakken Shale, Oasis geologists also came to that conclusion.

Sidetrack #4 was kicked off of Sidetrack #2 at 14,500’. Directional drillers were instructed by Oasis’s
drilling department to stay 10’ of TVD below Sidetrack #2 at all times, and to not steer using gamma
markers until safely past the first wellbore attempt. At this time, it was known that between the two shale
strikes from 15,622’ to 15,947’ that there was a -2.69° down dip. At 16,315’ a stop card was pulled by
onsite geology because low gamma counts of 30 api were witnessed, along with the bit building to 91.31°
resulting in a TVD of 10,842’. After speaking via phone call with Oasis Geology and drilling
superintendents the decision was made to drop through target to a TVD of 10,871’ (a vertical drop of nearly
30’) at 17,000’ or approximately 6,300’ VS. Anticipating that the steep dip was still present Sunburst
Geology agreed with the plan and directional proceeded ahead sliding down and keeping inclinations low
enough, as to move down in section and gain on dip. The bit drilled to the deepest TVD of 10,857’ when a
combination of upward slides and building while rotating brought the bit upward 2’ of TVD to 10,855’. At
17,015’ a slide was initiated to attempt to push the bit back under dip. At 17,030’ while sliding 160L rates
of penetration increased from 2.1 minutes per foot to 1.13 minutes per foot, and weight on bit dropped off,
which are classic signs of a shale strike. The driller was forced to stop drilling at 17,079’ because he was
unable to rotate ahead. A bottoms up was circulated confirming a shale strike. The approximate TVD of
the shale strike was 10,855.77’. Considering we had previously drilled deeper than this, along with the fact
that we were chasing a -2.70° down dip and confronted the shale with an inclination of 89.77° it was
originally thought that it was the Upper Bakken Shale. Upon further investigation Geology was indecisive
about which shale had been contacted. Recent dip calculation and bit inclination were suggestive of an
Upper Bakken strike, but regional structure indicated a Lower Bakken Shale strike.

A fifth sidetrack was started at 16,825’ and drilled to a depth of 16,834’ at which point it was abandoned
due the indecisiveness of the previous shale strike.

Oasis Geologists reached out to Sunburst Geology and the question of differentiating Upper from Lower
Bakken Shale was asked as well as if minerals were present in sample cuttings that would prove the presence
of a fault. Sunburst Geology went through all the of the shale samples that were onsite and concluded that
there were no minerals out of the ordinary, no visible indications of coming into contact with a fault, and
general lithology of both shales was too similar to distinguish between the two. Oasis requested to have the
samples pulled from the Lower Bakken Shale strike while coming into the first lateral lab tested against the
shale strike samples in the sidetracks. The Lower Bakken Shale samples were inspected, however the low
quality and quantity of actual shale in those cuttings made extensive testing implausible. With the inability
to distinguish between the shales through sample cuttings and gamma signature, the decision was made by
Oasis to drill a sixth sidetrack at a depth between both known shales and proceed ahead cautiously.

At 16,235’ Sidetrack #6 was drilled off of Sidetrack #4. The sidetrack was initially drilled downward
dropping in TVD by 8’. 15’ surveys were taken at this time and Sunburst was in contact with Oasis
Operations Geologist after each survey, as well as drilling superintendents. Per discussion with the drilling
superintendent Sunburst requested that the wellbore was not dropped past a depth of 10,855’ TVD as to
avoid the depth at which the previous shale strike took place and the Oasis drilling superintendent agreed,
at an approximate MD of 16,450’ and TVD of 10,850’ the wellbore was leveled off with hopes to contact
a recognizable gamma signature and calculate dip rate. As the wellbore was drilled ahead gamma closely
resembled that of near to under target center. As drilling continued with near flat inclinations gamma

Lessons Learned

While drilling Sidetrack #2 the accuracy of surveys and calculated TVD came into question. When there is
an initial curve landing and drill out that produces severe dog legs, the accuracy of calculated TVD can
have a large factor on TVD error. As a result, it’s possible to have two wells drilled at the same TVD but
at completely different portions of target, or in this case the shale. It’s always best to just “drill the well
you’re on”. Forcing gamma overlays to match with previously drilled wellbores can spell disaster quickly.
The further you drill out, closing in on TD, makes the survey accuracy even worse. Drilling a lateral with
intentions to TD at a certain TVD based on offset control, can be helpful at times, but should rarely outweigh


a recent, confident gamma correlation tied to a nearby stratigraphic type log. Projected structure should
always be changed to actual apparent dip, based on recorded data.

Extensive testing, as suggested by Oasis, should be done on Upper Bakken and Lower Bakken samples in
the near future. This testing could have prevented Sidetrack #3 along with much of the confusion of the
shale strike terminating Sidetrack #4.

When following steep local dips, it’s best to stop after a substantial amount of TVD has been drilled to
reevaluate the situation and recalculate dip. It’s imperative to catch and follow local structure, keeping
regional structure in mind as well to anticipate any changes.

Finally, no matter how many wells are drilled on a pad, it does not mean that the subject well is going to
follow that same structure. Following calculated structure known to be true with the data available is always
best, as well as using regional dip as a secondary tool. Ignoring current gamma correlations to follow TVD
targets based off control wells can be disastrous over great distances as TVD error compounds with each
survey.

Summary

The Lewis Federal 5300 11-31 4BR is a well in Oasis Petroleum’s horizontal Middle Bakken Member
development program, in McKenzie County, North Dakota. The project was drilled from surface casing to
total depth in 40 days. A total depth of 20,780’ MD was achieved at 20:45 hours on 29 March 2019. The
well-site team worked together to maintain the final sidetrack in the desired target interval for 97% within
target.

Samples in the Middle Bakken Member are predominantly silty sandstone. These samples are light to
medium gray, light brown, and occasionally cream silty sandstone. The silty sandstone is fine to very fine
grained. The middle member typically contains sub round and occasionally sub-angular grains. Samples
are smooth, moderately sorted and poorly cemented by calcite. Rare quantities of disseminated and nodular
pyrite are present as is trace to fair intergranular porosity. Trace to rare light-medium brown, spotty oil stain
was visible in most of these samples. The overall hydrocarbon “cuts”, gas and hydrocarbon shows were
encouraging and indicate an oil and gas rich system in the Middle Bakken Member.

The Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC, Lewis Federal 5300 11-31 4BR awaits completion operations
to determine its ultimate production potential and commercial value.

became non-descript, which was most indicative of moving through the lower half of target. At this point
it was concluded that the previous shale strike was that of the Lower Bakken and a dip reversal took place.
Near 17,100’ a stop card was pulled by Sunburst Geology. Knowing the TVD of the Lower Bakken Shale
was at 10,855’ and having data suggestive of dip rolling over, becoming upward of more than 1°, it was
imperative to slide up immediately to avoid another Lower Bakken strike. A sliding plan was then put in
place with directional and the wellbore was safely veered back into target following a dip of +1.18°. As the
wellbore ascended through target gamma overlaid near perfectly with the type log. Using the method of
rotating and allowing the bit to gently build followed by a down slide, and gentle descent it was possible to
find repeating gamma markers with indisputable dip calculations. Gamma markers mirrored the type log
from 20,243’ to 20,780’ while descending almost the entire target confirming our correct position. Upon
reaching TD the wellbore was just above the base of target.

Throughout each sidetrack regardless of position in zone the assembly consistently built inclination on
rotation. There did not appear to be any noticeable hard streaks or intervals that were more or less favorable
in relation to ROP. Drilling parameters proved to be the best and most reliable indication of a shale strike.
It was impossible to pinpoint stratigraphic position or proximity to shales on sample cuttings alone, nor was
it possible to differentiate an upper from lower shale strike.

The Lewis Federal 5300 11-31 4BR had an estimated overall formation dip of approximately -0.40°, which
resulted in a shallower gross dip than that of the Lewis Federal 5300 11-31 3B. Local formation was much
more severe from 5,000’ VS to 6,000’ VS, with averaged dips of -1.30°. From 6,000’ VS to 8,000’ VS
unexpected up dips averaging +0.50° were present, follow by an average dip of -0.73° to TD. The lateral
was drilled in 23 days from casing exit to total depth, with 13 lateral assemblies. A total depth of 20,780”
MD was achieved at 20:45 hours on March 29, 2019.

Hydrocarbon Shows

Gas was continuously recorded from 3,650’ to the completion of the lateral, along with the monitoring of
free oil at the possum belly and shakers. In the closed mud system, hydrostatic conditions were maintained
near balance, this allowed gas and fluid gains from the well to be evaluated. During the vertical, gas shows
ranged from 10 to 1,145 units, against a 10.4 to 12.9 pound per gallon (PPG) diesel-invert, mud weight.
Background concentrations in the lateral ranged from 200 to 3,000 units while several shows exceeded
3,500u. Upon starting Sidetrack #4 at 14,500’ the gas buster was turned on, gases averaged 1,000 to 3,000
units after that point, against a 9.35-9.6 PPG saltwater gel drilling fluid. Chromatography of gas revealed
typical concentrations of methane, ethane and propane characteristic of the Middle Bakken. Sample cuttings
were examined for hydrocarbon “cut” by immersion of trichloroethylene and inspection under a UV
fluoroscope. Fluorescent cuts were generally pale yellow in color and had a diffuse habit at a slow to
moderate speed. Visible green oil sheen was present at the shakers while drilling Sidetrack #6, as well as a
bright orange 5’-10’ intermittent flare. While tripping at 20,195’ a forceful, almost geyser-like flare was
present of 20’+, along with large amounts of green oil at the shaker (Figures 5 and 6 next page).

LITHOLOGY

Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC

Lewis Federal 5300 11-31 4BR

Sunburst geologists caught 50’ sample intervals from 3,650’-6,150’; 30’ sample intervals from 8,260’ to
11,152’; 1’-5’ sample intervals while side-tracking/time drilling; and 50’ sample intervals through the lateral
to TD at 20,780’. Additional spot samples were caught through the vertical, curve, and lateral as needed.
Side-track depths, formation tops, and lithologic markers have been inserted into the sample descriptions
below for reference. Samples were examined wet and dry under a binocular microscope. Sample
fluorescent cuts are masked by invert mud through 11,540’, at which time the drilling fluid was displaced to
Salt Water. Quantifiers in order of increasing abundance are trace, rare, occasional, common and
abundant. One set of sample cuttings were packaged and mailed to the North Dakota Geological Survey
Core Library, per state requirement, with the exception of side-track #1.

Dear MICHAEL KUKUK:

North Dakota Century Code Section 38-08-04 provides for the preservation of cores and samples and their shipment to the
State Geologist when requested. The following is required on the above referenced well:

1) All cores, core chips and samples must be submitted to the State Geologist as provided for under North Dakota
Century Code: Section 38-08-04 and North Dakota Administrative Code: Section 43-02-03-38.1.

2) Samples: The Operator is to begin collecting sample drill cuttings no lower than the:
Base of the Last Charles Salt
- Sample cuttings shall be collected at:
o 30' maximum intervals through all vertical and build sections.
o 200' maximum intervals through any horizontal sections.
- Samples must be washed, dried, placed in standard sample envelopes (3” x 4.5”), packed in the correct order into
standard sample boxes (3.5” x 5.25” x 15.25”).
- Samples boxes are to be carefully identified with a label that indicates the operator, well name, well file number,
American Petroleum Institute (API) number, location and depth of samples; and forwarded in to the state core
and sample library within 30 days of the completion of drilling operations.

3) Cores: Any cores cut shall be preserved in correct order, boxed in standard core boxes (4.5”, 4.5”, 35.75”), and the
entire core forwarded to the state core and samples library within 180 days of completion of drilling operations.
Any extension of time must have approval on a Form 4 Sundry Notice.

Conductors, Rat holes, and Mouse holes

To protect near surface groundwater any conductor, rat, or mouse hole drilled must be constructed with a string of
casing and cemented to ground level. Any such string must be secured at the surface when not in use. In addition, all rat and
mouse holes must be plugged with cement and cut off at least 4’ below final grade within a reasonable timeframe after the rig
completes drilling operations on the pad.

Permit Fee & Notification

Payment was received in the amount of $100 via credit card. It is requested that notification be given immediately
upon the spudding of the well. This information should be relayed to the Oil & Gas Division, Bismarck, via telephone (701)
328-8020. The following information must be included: Well name, legal location, permit number, drilling contractor and rig
number, company representative, date and time of spudding. Office hours are 8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and 1:00 p.m. to 5:00
p.m. Central Time. Please leave a message if after hours or on the weekend.

DRILLING PROVISIONS:
Casing Strings
Due to the possibility of severe casing wear during the drilling of the vertical and curve sections of the well, which
could compromise isolation of the Fox Hills Formation, operators are not to deviate in the surface casing portion of the hole.
All strings of surface casing shall stand cemented under pressure for at least 12 hours before drilling the plug or
initiating tests. Surface casing, production or intermediate casing strings must be allowed to stand under pressure until the tail
cement has reached a compressive strength of at least 500 psi before drilling the plug or initiating tests.

Survey Requirements for Horizontal, Horizontal Re-entry, and Directional Wells

NDAC Section 43-02-03-25 (Deviation Tests and Directional Surveys) states in part (that) the survey contractor shall
file a certified copy of all surveys with the director free of charge within thirty days of completion. Surveys must be
submitted as one electronic copy, or in a form approved by the director. However, the director may require the directional
survey to be filed immediately after completion if the survey is needed to conduct the operation of the director's office in a
timely manner. Certified surveys must be submitted via email in one adobe document, with a certification cover page to
certsurvey@nd.gov.
Survey points shall be of such frequency to accurately determine the entire location of the well bore.
Specifically, the Horizontal and Directional well survey frequency is 100 feet in the vertical, 30 feet in the curve (or when
sliding) and 90 feet in the lateral.

Logs

NDAC Section 43-02-03-31 requires the running of (1) a suite of open hole logs from which formation tops and
porosity zones can be determined, (2) a Gamma Ray Log run from total depth to ground level elevation of the well bore, and
(3) a log from which the presence and quality of cement can be determined (Standard CBL or ultrasonic cement evaluation

McKenzie County, North Dakota
Well File # 36047

Dear Jennifer:

Pursuant to Commission Order No. 29373, approval to drill the above captioned well is hereby given. The approval is
granted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than the 500! setback from the
north & south boundaries and 150' setback from the east & west boundaries within the 1280 acre spacing unit consisting of
Sections 31 & 32 'T153N-R100W. The east setback is based on a production liner cemented in the lateral with a wet shoe
and the ability to frac out the shoe.

PERMIT STIPULATIONS:

e Remote or automatic shut off devices required on all equipment.

e Pursuant to NDAC 43-02-03-48.1 (CPF-Comingling of Production) “The director shall have authority to
approve requests to consolidate production equipment at a central location”. Oasis must run a CBL on the 9-
5/8” intermediate string which is proposed to isolate the Dakota Group prior to running 7” casing.

e Oasis must contact NDIC Field Inspector Richard Dunn at 701-770-3554 prior to location construction.

SITE PROVISIONS:
Location Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period)

Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the
approved drilling permit on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report. If circumstances require operations to commence
before the 3rd business day following publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may be waived by the
Director. Application for a waiver must be by sworn affidavit providing the information necessary to evaluate the
extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(, and any other information that would allow the
Director to conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the drilling permit, the applicant should retain the
permit.

Perimeter Berm
A location perimeter berm is required surrounding the entire location.

Drilling pit

NDAC 43-02-03-19.4 states that “a pit may be utilized to bury drill cuttings and solids generated during well drilling
and completion operations, providing the pit can be constructed, used and reclaimed in a manner that will prevent pollution
of the land surface and freshwaters. Reserve and circulation of mud system through earthen pits are prohibited. All pits shall
be inspected by an authorized representative of the director prior to lining and use. Drill cuttings and solids must be
stabilized in a manner approved by the director prior to placement in a cuttings pit.”

SPUDDING PROVISIONS:
Filter Socks

A covered leak-proof container (with placard) for filter sock disposal must be maintained on the well site beginning
when the well is spud, and must remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations
are conducted.

RE: Filter Socks and Other Filter Media
Leakproof Container Required
Oil and Gas Wells

Dear Operator,

North Dakota Administrative Code Section 43-02-03-19.2 states in part that all waste material associated with
exploration or production of oil and gas must be properly disposed of in an authorized facility in accord with all
applicable local, state, and federal laws and regulations.

Filtration systems are commonly used during oil and gas operations in North Dakota. The Commission is very
concerned about the proper disposal of used filters (including filter socks) used by the oil and gas industry.

Effective June 1, 2014, a container must be maintained on each well drilled in North Dakota beginning when the
well is spud and must remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations
are conducted. The on-site container must be used to store filters until they can be properly disposed of in an
authorized facility. Such containers must be:

e leakproof to prevent any fluids from escaping the container

e covered to prevent precipitation from entering the container

e placard to indicate only filters are to be placed in the container

If the operator will not utilize a filtration system, a waiver to the container requirement will be considered, but
only upon the operator submitting a Sundry Notice (Form 4) justifying their request.

As previously stated in our March 13, 2014 letter, North Dakota Administrative Code Section 33-20-02.1-01
states in part that every person who transports solid waste (which includes oil and gas exploration and production
wastes) is required to have a valid permit issued by the North Dakota Department of Health, Division of Waste
Management. Please contact the Division of Waste Management at (701) 328-5166 with any questions on the
solid waste program. Note oil and gas exploration and production wastes include produced water, drilling mud,
invert mud, tank bottom sediment, pipe scale, filters, and fly ash.

Thank you for your cooperation.

Sincerely,

Brace E. Fichs
