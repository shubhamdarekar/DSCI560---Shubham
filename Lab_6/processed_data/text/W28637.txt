STRIPPER WELL DETERMINATION

Dear Mr. Travis:

Oasis Petroleum North America LLC (Oasis) filed with the North Dakota Industrial Commission
— Oil and Gas Division (Commission) on June 12, 2019 an application for a Stripper Well
Determination for the above captioned well.

Information contained in the application indicates that the above mentioned well is a stripper
well pursuant to statute and rule, and Oasis has elected to designate said well as a stripper well.
The well produced from a well depth greater than 10000 feet and was completed after June 30,
2013. During the qualifying period, August 1, 2017 through July 31, 2018, the well produced at
a maximum efficient rate or was not capable of exceeding the production threshold. The average
daily production from the well was 34.4 barrels of oil per day during this period.

It is therefore determined that the above captioned well qualifies as a “Stripper Well” pursuant to
Section 57-51.1-01 of the North Dakota Century Code. This determination is applicable only to
the Bakken Pool in and under said well.

The Commission shall have continuing jurisdiction, and shall have the authority to review the
matter, and to amend or rescind the determination if such action is supported by additional or
newly discovered information. If you have any questions, do not hesitate to contact me.
Sincerely,
David & McCusker

INTRODUCTION

The Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC Chalmers 5300 21-19 10T [Lot 2 Section 19,
T153N, R1OOW] is located approximately 7 miles south of the city of Williston in McKenzie
County, North Dakota. The Chalmers 5300 21-19 10T is a horizontal Three Forks well within
the Williston Basin consisting of one 9,444' uncased lateral drilled toward the east. The vertical
hole was planned to be drilled to approximately 10,341’. The curve would be built at 12 degrees
per 100’ to land within the Three Forks. This well is a two section lateral which originates in the
northwest quarter of section 19, then drilled east to the southeast quarter of section 20.
Directional drilling technologies and geosteering techniques were used to land in the Three Forks
reservoir and maintain exposure to the ideal target rock.

OFFSET WELLS

Offset well data used for depth correlation during curve operations are found in the ‘Control
Data’ section appended to this report. Offset well control was essential in curve operations, to
successfully land within the Three Forks. Formation thicknesses expressed by gamma ray
signatures in these wells were compared to gamma data collected during drilling operations in
order to successfully land the curve. The target landing true vertical depth (TVD) was
periodically updated during drilling to ensure accurate landing of the curve.

GEOLOGY

The Charles Formation [Mississippian Madison Group] was logged 8,537' MD 8,536' TVD
(-6,460' SS). Samples in the lower portion of the Charles Formation consisted of a limestone
mudstone, which was light brown, light gray brown, off white in color. It was microcrystalline,
firm-friable, laminated, with an earthy texture. A trace of intercrystalline porosity, as was rare
spotty light brown oil stain Occasionally noted was a dolomite mudstone, which was light
brown, light gray brown in color. It was microcrystalline, friable-firm, laminated, with an earthy
texture. Also noted was a trace of intercrystalline porosity, and occasional spotty light brown oil
stain. Rarely noted was anhydrite, which was off white and cream in color. It was soft,
microcrystalline, and massive with an earthy to amorphous texture. Following connections or
periods of non-circulation, gas peaks of 32 to 77 units were noted, as were drilling gas shows of
24 to 103 units.

The Mission Canyon Formation [Mississippian Madison Group] was logged 9,436' MD 9,435'
TVD (-7,359' SS). The Mission Canyon Formation consisted of a lime mudstone that was
described as light gray, light brown, gray brown, trace dark gray in color. The lime mudstone
was predominately friable to firm, with an earthy to rarely crystalline in texture. Some intervals
contained a trace of black-brown algal material, a trace of fossil fragments, and traces of
disseminated pyrite. Also present was an
argillaceous lime mudstone that was described
as light gray, occasional medium gray, rare gray
tan, rare off white, trace dark gray in color. The
argillaceous lime mudstone was predominately
firm to friable, crystalline to chalky texture.
Some intervals contained a trace of disseminated
pyrite. Following connections or periods of
non-circulation, gas peaks of 63 to 160 units
were noted, as were drilling gas shows of 89 to
294 units. Rare intercrystalline porosity was
noted as well as traces to occasional spotty light
brown oil stain was occasionally observed while
logging the Mission Canyon Formation.

texture. Rare disseminated pyrite was noted as was occasional intercrystalline porosity. Also
noted was common spotty to rare even light brown oil stain. Also observed was light green-light
gray green, rare light gray shale that was firm, subblocky, with an earthy texture. Occasional
disseminated pyrite was noted as was possible intergranular porosity.

Gas Show

Gas monitoring and fluid gains provided evidence of a hydrocarbon saturated reservoir during
the drilling of the Chalmers 5300 21-19 10T. Oil and gas shows at the shakers and in samples
were continuously monitored. In the closed mud system, hydrostatic conditions were maintained
near balance, this allowed for gas and fluid gains from the well to be evaluated. Gas on the
Chalmers 5300 21-19 10T varied according to stratigraphic position and penetration rates which
may have reflected increased porosity. During the vertical, connection gas peaks of 35 to 160
units were noted, as were drilling gas shows of 40 to 294 units, against a 10.25-11.45 lb/gal
diesel-invert mud weight. Background concentrations in the lateral ranged from 400 to 1,600
units, against a 9.75-9.8 Ib/gal saltwater gel drilling fluid. Connection peaks of 1,200 to 2,284
units were observed, coinciding with the best shows. Drilling out of casing at 11,140 MD’
yielded a trip/downtime gas of 2,227 units. Trips at 14,466’ MD, a short trip to 8,375’ MD for a
washed pipe at 15,042’ MD, and a trip at 17,024’ MD yielded trip gas of 2,278 units, and 1,968
units, and 1,077 units respectively. Chromatography of gas revealed typical concentrations of
methane, characteristic of Three Forks gas.

The Upper Bakken Shale [Mississippian Bakken Formation] was drilled at 10,777' MD 10,727'
TVD (-8,651' SS). Entry into this member was characterized by high gamma, elevated
background gas and increased rates of penetration. The black to black gray carbonaceous and
petroliferous shale was hard with a splintery to smooth texture. Fracture porosity was noted, and
trace minerals were observed to include disseminated pyrite and calcite fracture fill.
Hydrocarbons evaluated in this interval reached a maximum of 1,472 units.

The Middle Bakken [Mississippian-Devonian Bakken Formation] was drilled at 10,803' MD
10,743' TVD (-8,667' SS). Samples in the Middle Bakken Member were predominantly silty
sandstone which was described as light gray brown, light brown, trace light gray in color. It was
very fine grained, friable, subround, smooth, moderately sorted, with calcite cement, moderately
cemented. A trace of disseminated and nodular pyrite was noted as was fair intergranular
porosity. Also noted was occasional light brown spotty oil stain. Hydrocarbons evaluated in this
interval reached a maximum of 614 units drilling gas, with a survey gas of 750 units, and
connection gas of 721 units.

The Lower Bakken Shale [Devonian Bakken
Formation] was drilled at 10,880' MD
10,785' TVD (-8,709' SS). Entry into this
interval was characterized by high gamma,
elevated background gas and increased rates *
of penetration. The carbonaceous _ black,
black gray shale is petroliferous, hard,
splintery, smooth and exhibits possible
fracture porosity. Trace minerals included
disseminated pyrite. Drilling gas in this
interval reached a maximum of 1,074 units.

gray siltstone from the underlying Pronghorn Member.

The Pronghorn Member [Devonian-Bakken Formation] was reached at 10,906' MD 10,796' TVD
(-8,720' SS). Entry into this interval was characterized by lower gamma, and slightly slower
penetration rates. Samples from the Pronghorn were siltstone which was dark gray trace gray
black, friable to firm, subblocky to subsplit. This siltstone was moderately dolomite cemented
and included disseminated and nodular pyrite. Also noted was a trace of spotty light brown oil
stain. Drilling gas in this interval reached a maximum of 552 units with a connection gas of 529
units.

The Three Forks [Devonian] was reached at 10,956' MD 10,814' TVD (-8,738' SS) which was -
1’ low to the Oasis Petroleum NA, LLC Chalmers 5300 21-19 8T. The target zone of the Three
Forks was to be drilled in a predominately dolomitic 11 foot zone beginning 16 feet into the
Three Forks.

Samples in the Three Forks were predominantly dolomite which was described as light brown,
light gray, tan-cream, peach, trace pink in color. It was firm, laminated, with a microsucrosic

Geosteering

Ryan Energy Technologies provided personnel and equipment for measurement-while-drilling
(MWD) services. The RPM directional drillers, Ryan MWD’s, and Sunburst Consulting
personnel worked closely together throughout the project to evaluate data and make steering
decisions to maximize the amount of borehole in the targeted zones and increase rate of
penetration (ROP) of the formation.

The 805’ curve first drilled 44’ in 1 hour before a MWD failure caused it to be tripped out of the
hole and the MWD replaced. The remainder of the curve was drilled in 25 hours with a bottom
hole assembly (BHA) consisting of bit #5/re-run #4, a Smith MDI516 PDC bit, attached to a 2.38
degree fixed NOV 7/8 5.0 motor. The curve was successfully landed at 11,140’ MD and 10,834’
TVD, approximately 20’ into the Three Forks Formation. Seven inch diameter 32# HCP-110
casing was set to 11,118’ MD.

Geologic structure maps of the Chalmers 5300 21-19 10T and surrounding control wells had
estimated formation dip to be approximately 0.5° down to the TD of the lateral. The preferred
drilling interval of the Chalmers 5300 21-19 10T consisted of a eleven foot zone located
approximately sixteen feet into the Three Forks Formation. Penetration rates, gas shows, gamma
ray data, and sample observations were utilized to keep the wellbore in the preferred
stratigraphic position in the target zone. Using offset well data provided by Oasis representatives,
projected porosity zones were identified in the preferred drilling areas.

Figure 9. Offset well target definition, Indian Hills Prospect (Oasis).

Steering decisions were made by using target points and letter markers provided by Oasis
personnel. The low gamma (F) in the middle to lower portion of the target zone was often
utilized to establish the well-bore’s position in the target zone. If the well-bore moved toward the
bottom of the target zone, the moderate gamma was observed. As the well-bore moved lower in
formation, the higher gamma of the underlying claystone (G) was observed, as was the presence
of claystone in collected samples. Slides were then utilized to move the well-bore back up into
the target zone. In accordance with the drilling plan the well-bore was steered down into the
underlying claystone at prescribed intervals in order to definitively establish the well-bore’s

position in formation. As the well-bore moved higher, approaching the top of the target zone the
high to medium fluctuating gamma between markers (D & E) was noted. Samples in the lower
gamma portion of the target zone contained noticeably greater concentrations of the light brown,
tan-cream, peach, trace pink dolomite; as the well-bore moved higher in zone the samples tended
to have more of the light gray, off white, gray brown dolomite. The TD of 20,562’ MD was
achieved at 08:25 hours CT February 18, 2015. The well site team worked together to maintain
the well bore in the desired target interval for 94% of the lateral, opening 9,444’ of potentially
productive reservoir rock. The hole was then circulated and reamed for completion.

SUMMARY

The Chalmers 5300 21-19 1OT is a successful well in Oasis Petroleum’s horizontal Three Forks
development program in Baker Field. The project was drilled from surface casing to TD in 18
days. The TD of 20,562’ MD was achieved at 08:25 hours CT February 19, 2015. The well site
team worked together to maintain the well bore in the desired target interval for 94% of the
lateral, opening 9,444’ of potentially productive reservoir rock.

Samples in the Three Forks were predominantly dolomite which was described as light brown,
light gray, tan-cream, peach, trace pink in color. It was firm, laminated, with a microsucrosic
texture. Rare disseminated pyrite was noted as was occasional intercrystalline porosity. Also
noted was common spotty to rare even light brown oil stain. Also observed was light green-light
gray green, rare light gray shale that was firm, subblocky, with an earthy texture. Occasional
disseminated pyrite was noted as was possible intergranular porosity.

Gas on the Chalmers 5300 21-19 10T varied according to stratigraphic position and penetration
rates which may have reflected increased porosity. The overall gas and hydrocarbon shows were
encouraging and indicate a hydrocarbon rich system in the Three Forks.

The Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC. Chalmers 5300 21-19 10T awaits completion
operations to determine its ultimate production potential.

LITHOLOGY

Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC
Chalmers 5300 21-19 10T

Rig crews caught 30’ sample intervals, under the supervision of Sunburst geologists, from 8,240’ to the
TD of the lateral at 20,562’. Formation tops and lithologic markers have been inserted into the sample
descriptions below for reference. Sample descriptions begin in the Kibbey Formation just prior to the
Kibbey Lime. Samples were examined wet and dry under a binocular microscope. Sample fluorescent
cuts are masked by invert mud through intermediate casing. Quantifiers in order of increasing abundance
are trace, rare, occasional, common and abundant.

rtical Log Descriptions: MD /TVD (MSL Datum

8,240-8,270 SILTSTONE: red brown, soft, sub blocky, calcareous cement, poorly cemented, no visible

3. Damage to the casing during the frac would be detected immediately by montioring equipement;

4. The casing is exposed to significantly lower rates and pressures during flowback than during the frac job;
5. The frac fluid and formation fluids have very low corrosion and erosion rates;

6. Production equipment will be installed as soon as possible after the well ceases flowing;

7. A 300# gauge will be installed on the surface casing during the flowback period

Well File # 28637
Dear Brandi:

Pursuant to Commission Order No. 23752, approval to drill the above captioned well is hereby given. The
approval is granted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than
the 500' setback from the north & south boundaries and 200' setback from the east & west boundaries within the
1280 acre spacing unit consisting of Sections 19 & 20 T153N R100W.

PERMIT STIPULATIONS: Effective June 1, 2014, a covered leak-proof container (with placard) for
filter sock disposal must be maintained on the well site beginning when the well is spud, and must
remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations are
conducted. Due to the proximity of Lake Sakakawea to the well site, a dike is required surrounding the
entire location. OASIS PETRO NO AMER must contact NDIC Field Inspector Richard Dunn at 701-
770-3554 prior to location construction.

Drilling pit

NDAC 43-02-03-19.4 states that “a pit may be utilized to bury drill cuttings and solids generated during well
drilling and completion operations, providing the pit can be constructed, used and reclaimed in a manner that will
prevent pollution of the land surface and freshwaters. Reserve and circulation of mud system through earthen pits
are prohibited. All pits shall be inspected by an authorized representative of the director prior to lining and use.
Drill cuttings and solids must be stabilized in a manner approved by the director prior to placement in a cuttings

pit.”

Form 1 Changes & Hard Lines

Any changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC.
The proposed directional plan is at a legal location. Based on the azimuth of the proposed lateral the maximum
legal coordinate from the well head is: 9972’ east.

Location Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period)

Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the
approved drilling permit on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report. If circumstances require operations to
commence before the 3rd business day following publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may
be waived by the Director. Application for a waiver must be by sworn affidavit providing the information
necessary to evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f, and any other
information that would allow the Director to conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the
drilling permit, the applicant should retain the permit.

DETAILS OF WORK

Oasis Petroleum North America LLC requests permission for suspension of drilling for up to 90 days for the
referenced well under NDAC 43-02-03-55. Oasis Petroleum North America LLC intends to drill the surface hole with
freshwater based drilling mud and set surface casing with a small drilling rig and move off within 3 to 5 days. The
casing will be set at a depth pre-approved by the NDIC per the Application for Permit to Drill NDAC 43-02-03-21. No
saltwater will be used in the drilling and cementing operations of the surface casing. Once the surface casing is
cemented, a plug or mechanical seal will be placed at the top of the casing to prevent any foreign matter from getting
into the well. A rig capable of drilling to TD will move onto the location within the 90 days previously outlined to
complete the drilling and casing plan as per the APD. The undersigned states that this request for suspension of
drilling operations in accordance with the Subsection 4 of Section 43-02-03-55 of the NDAC, is being requested to
take advantage of the cost savings and time savings of using an initial rig that is smaller than the rig necessary to
drill a well to total depth but is not intended to alter or extend the terms and conditions of, or suspend any obligation
under, any oil and gas lease with acreage in or under the spacing or drilling unit for the above-referenced well. Oasis
Petroleum North America LLC understands NDAC 43-02-03-31 requirements regarding confidentiality pertaining to
this permit. The drilling pit will be fenced immediately after construction if the well pad is located in a pasture (NDAC
43-02-03-19 & 19.1). Oasis Petroleum North America LL will plug and abandon the well and reclaim the well site if the
well is not drilled by the larger rotary rig within 90 days after spudding the well with the smaller drilling rig.

Notify NDIC inspector Richard Dunn at 701-770-3554 with spud and TD info.

OIL AND GAS DIVISION

April 9, 2014

RE: Filter Socks and Other Filter Media
Leakproof Container Required
Oil and Gas Wells

Dear Operator,

North Dakota Administrative Code Section 43-02-03-19.2 states in part that all waste material associated with
exploration or production of oil and gas must be properly disposed of in an authorized facility in accord with all
applicable local, state, and federal laws and regulations.

Filtration systems are commonly used during oil and gas operations in North Dakota. The Commission is very
concerned about the proper disposal of used filters (including filter socks) used by the oil and gas industry.

Effective June 1, 2014, a container must be maintained on each well drilled in North Dakota beginning when the
well is spud and must remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations
are conducted. The on-site container must be used to store filters until they can be properly disposed of in an
authorized facility. Such containers must be:

e leakproof to prevent any fluids from escaping the container

e covered to prevent precipitation from entering the container

e placard to indicate only filters are to be placed in the container

If the operator will not utilize a filtration system, a waiver to the container requirement will be considered, but
only upon the operator submitting a Sundry Notice (Form 4) justifying their request.

As previously stated in our March 13, 2014 letter, North Dakota Administrative Code Section 33-20-02.1-01
states in part that every person who transports solid waste (which includes oil and gas exploration and production
wastes) is required to have a valid permit issued by the North Dakota Department of Health, Division of Waste
Management. Please contact the Division of Waste Management at (701) 328-5166 with any questions on the
solid waste program. Note oil and gas exploration and production wastes include produced water, drilling mud,
invert mud, tank bottom sediment, pipe scale, filters, and fly ash.

Thank you for your cooperation.

Sincerely,

Brace E. Fichs

Assistant Director

Re: | Un-Occupied Trailer House and Seasonal Cabin.

Brandi,

Just to follow up with past conversations about the dwellings east of our proposed Chalmer
5300 21-19 well site. The white trailer is unlivable, it has no water, power or sewer. The cabin
is seasonal at best and has not been used for several years. If | can be of further assistance

please advise.
