Control Wells

Two completed wells were used as control offsets for the Wade Federal 5300 21-30H.

The Verlin Fossum Et Al 26-1 [NW SE Sec. 26 T153N R101 W] is a vertical well owned by
Harper Oil Company. The Verlin Fossum Et Al 26- lis located approximately 1.4 miles west of
Wade Federal 21-30H. The initial pilot well for the Verlin Fossum Et Al 26-1 was spud on 31
December 1979. The Verlin Fossum Et Al 26-1was drilled to the Red River Formation.

The Federal Land Bank 1-26 [NE NW Sec. 26 T153N R101 W] is a dry vertical well drilled to
the Red River Formation by Mosbacher-Pruet Oil CO. The Federal Land Bank 1-26 is located
approximately 1.4 miles northwest of the Wade Federal 5300 21-30H. Federal Land Bank 1-26
was spud 16 July 1978.

During the curve, the gamma-ray data and e-log data from Verlin Fossum Et Al 26-1 were
utilized to help determine proper landing depth for Wade Federal 5300 21-30H.

A graph was constructed to determine which markers and formation tops could be accurately

used in landing the curve. Markers with more than 5 feet difference between the offsets were
watched but not utilized in decision for moving the TVD target of the curve.

Geologic Assessment

Methods

Geologic supervision of Wade Federal 5300 21-30Hwas provided by two experienced RPM well
site geologists. Gas and chromatograph levels were measured using iBall Instruments
Bloodhound (Bloodhound) real time gas detector and chromatograph system. The Bloodhound
gas detection system uses non-dispersive infrared and chemical sensor gas detection to evaluate
gases liberated from the formation by the drill bit and carried to the surface by the drilling fluid.

The Bloodhound was interfaced with a Canrig electronic data recorder system. Canrig provided
rate of penetration, on-off bottom and pump strokes to the Bloodhound and received total gas
information from the Bloodhound for viewing on location and remotely.

Under the direction of RPM well site geologist, rig crews were instructed to catch lagged drill
cutting samples at 30’ intervals from 8,250 to the kick off point (KOP) at 10,172’. Samples were
continuously logged at 30’ intervals during the curve and throughout the lateral section.

Sampled drill cuttings were examined wet and dry under a binocular microscope using plain
(broad spectrum) and transmitted light. Cuttings were evaluated for hydrocarbon “cut” by
immersion in carbo-sol (trichloroethylene) and inspection under a UV fluoroscope. 10%
hydrochloric acid and alizarin red were used to determine the calcareous and dolomitic content
of rocks and cementing.

Vertical Operations

Overview

The Wade Federal 5300 21-30H was spud on 5 April 2011 using Nabors 149 drilling rig. Prior
to Rig up of RPM mud logging services, a 9 5/8” hole was drilled with fresh water to

depth of 2,018’ and isolated with 9 5/8” 36# J-55 casing cemented to surface. The vertical
borehole was drilled with bit #1 in 9 hours with an average ROP equal to 213.3 ft/hr. Bit #2 (8
¥%4” Smith PDC) was used to drill from 2,018’ to KOP at 10,172’ yielding an average ROP of
95.8 ft/hr.

RPM well site geologists arrived at site on 10 April 2011 and began logging the vertical section
at 8,250’.

Diesel invert drilling fluid with a mud weight of ranging from 9.7-10.0 ppg was used during
remainder of the vertical hole and in the curve builds sections.

Schlumberger performed openhole electronic logging operations on 13 April 2011.

Lithology

The top of the Kibbey Lime [Mississippian Madison Group] was logged at 8,320’ (-6,008’), 83’
low to the Verlin Fossum 26-1. Samples from this interval (Figure 1) were described as:

The top of the Lodgepole Formation of the Madison Group (Mississippian) was logged at
9,934’ (-7,896’), 79’ low to Verlin Fossum 26-1 (Figure 3). Samples collected from the
Lodgepole Formation were described as:

LIMESTONE: mudstone, medium to light brown, cryptocrystalline to microcrystalline,
firm to friable, crystalline to earthy texture, trace sparry calcite, argillaceous in part, no
visible oil stain, no visible porosity

Figure 3: Photograph of limestone from Lodgepole Formation

Directional Operations

RPM provided equipment and personnel for directional services. Ryan Energy Technologies
(Ryan) provided equipment and personnel for MWD services. RPM geologists worked closely
with RPM directional and Ryan MWD teams to formulate steering decisions to maximize
exposure of borehole in the pay zone. RPM well site geologists closely observed MWD gamma-
ray information and penetration rates to aid in steering decisions and dip degree estimations.

Curve Build

Overview

Bit #3 and was used in front of a 2.3° fixed mud motor to drill the curve from measured
depth 10,172’ to 11,023’. Bit #3, an 8 34” Security PDC was used to drill from 11,172’ to
11,023’ in 31.5 hours generating an average ROP of 27 ft/hr.

During the curve progression, isopach data of gamma-ray signatures from Verlin Fossum 26-1
was compared to gamma-ray readings from the MWD tool from the Base Charles Salt_ (Table
1). Prospective markers were entered into Table 2 to determine the target landing point. Based
on the marker pick for the Base Charles Salt, the target TVD for the curve was raised 10 feet to
11,655’ but was lowered back down to 10,670’ as the curve progressed. The curve was
completed at a measured depth of 11,020’and TVD of ~ 11,669’.

LIMESTONE: wackestone, off white, cream, light brown, firm to hard, microcrystalline,
crystalline texture, common fossils fragment, good visible porosity

The top of the Charles Salt [Mississippian Madison Group] was logged at 8,486’ (-6,448’), 93’
low to the Verlin Fossum 26-1. The Base Last Salt was drilled at 9,655’ (-6,264’), 66’ low to the
Verlin Fossum 26-1. Samples from this interval (Figure 1) were described as:

ANHYDRITE: white, dark gray, soft, cryptocrystalline, amorphous texture
LIMESTONE: mudstone, light to medium gray, soft, microcrystalline texture,
trace fossils fragment, very lite disseminated pyrite, no visible porosity;

interbedded white anhydrite in part

Salt: clear, milky, translucent, crystalline, hard, euhedral to subhedral, crystalline
texture

The top of the Mission Canyon Formation of the Madison Group [Mississippian] was
penetrated at 9,356’ (-7,318), 70’ low to the Verlin Fossum 26-1 (Figure 2). Samples from this
interval were described as:

LIMESTONE: mudstone to wackestone, mottled gray to brown, light gray,
microcrystalline, firm to soft, earthy texture, trace sparry calcite, trace fossils fragment,
no visible porosity, no visible oil stain; Trace ANHYDRITE

The curve was landed in the middle member of the Bakken Formation ~ 8’ below the Upper
Bakken Shale. Intermediate casing (7”) was set at measured depth 10,009’ and a TVD of
~10,669’.

Lithology

The top of the ‘False Bakken” was penetrated at a measured depth of 10,840’ (TVD 10,636’) (-
8,598) suggesting a target depth of 10,668’ TVD. Gas levels remained constant through the
False Bakken.

The Upper Shale of the Bakken Formation [Missippian — Devonian] was drilled at 10,876’
(TVD 10,648’) (-8,610’) with sample returns of typical black, carbonaceous and petroliferous
shale (Figure 5) characterized by gamma-ray values in excess of 250 API counts. Gas levels
elevated to a peak of 1468 units above the average background gas of ~70 units. Samples were
described as:

SHALE: very dark brown, subblocky, friable, waxy texture, very slightly calcareous, visible oil
stain, possible fracture porosity

Figure 5: Photograph sample from the Upper Bakken Shale.

The Middle Member of the Bakken Formation was penetrated at 10,944’ MD, (10,662’ TVD).
The upper zone of the middle member contained a tight grey siltstone with little or no oil stain or
visible porosity (Figure 6). This “Zone” of the Middle Bakken Formation is annotated by “A” on
Diagram |. Samples from the top of the Middle member were described as:

SILTSTONE: white to off white, light gray, very fine grained, firm to friable, sub rounded
to sub angular, vitreous, slightly to n calcareous, well sorted, poor cemented, trace
disseminated pyrite, trace patchy oil stain, trace intergranular porosity

Lateral
Overview

Drilling fluid consisting of an open system salt water brine (9.4 — 9.5 ppg) was substituted for
diesel invert while drilling the lateral section. one 6” PDC bits was used to drill the lateral.

Bit #4 (6” Smith FX64D), A PDC bit in front of a 1.5° mud motor was used to drill the entire
lateral from 11,023’ to 20,481’ (TD). Bit #4 drilled 9458’ in 236.5 hours with a mean ROP of
82.6 ft/hr.

Drilling operations were concluded at 0115 hours on 23 April 2011 at a bottom hole location of
23.03' S & 9971.67' E of surface location or approximately 2243.03' FNL & 311.76' FEL NW SE
NW Sec. 29 TI53N, RIOOW

Lithology

To aid in communications while drilling the lateral, a type log was created using the gamma
signature from The Verlin Fossum 26-1 (Diagram 1). The target zone was an area marked
roughly between the “B” and “D” markers on chart 1. The attempt was made to keep the well
bore in this region for as much of the drilling operations as possible.

The Middle Member of the Bakken Formation seen in drilling samples consisted of 2 primary
facies. The upper most was the gray siltstone seen while landing the curve and described above.
The second was described as sandstone interbedded with a light brown silty sandstone. This silty

Gas and Hydrocarbon Shows

Total gas levels were recorded with an average background of ~ 150 units while drilling

the curve through the Lodgepole Formation. At a measured depth of 10,520’ gas levels rose
quickly to a peak of near 1900 units and maintained a background of ~ 700 units. Gas levels
elevated sharply at the Upper Bakken Shale with a peak of 1450 units and an average
background gas of ~ 1000 units. Gas levels changed little after the penetration of the middle
member of the Bakken Formation until reaching intermediate casing point at 11,023’ MD.

Upon exiting the show gas levels immediately rose to over 2200 units. The gas remained
between 2000 and 2200 units until after a measured depth of 11,420 when levels rose to over
3000 units and remained at this level till the bit reach TD at a measured depth of 20,482’. The
Bloodhound gas chromatograph showed components of all C1-C4 present through the entire
lateral (Figure 10)

Hydrocarbon cuts using trichloroethylene were moderate though the entire lateral. The target
zone and above was characterized by weak white diffuse cuts and very few slow white streaming
cuts. No correlation was found between the strength of the hydrocarbon cuts and the position of
the bit in the Middle Bakken Formation

sandstone consisted of a siltstone that was flaky and grey in color interbedded with a light brown
sandstone (Figure 7). There was a substantial amount of oil stain present in the sandstone and
hydrocarbon cuts produced a weak diffuse cut with few streaming cuts Samples from the top of
the Middle Bakken member were described as:

SLTY SANDSTONE: white, tan to brown, light to medium gray, firm to friable, sub
rounded to sub angular, moderately sorted, calcite to dolomite cement, trace
disseminated and nodules pyrite, vitreous texture, trace intergranular porosity, possible
fracture porosity, moderately light brown oil stain, slightly faint white to yellow diffuse
cut

As the bit approached “D” in the middle member, silty sandstone was seen in sample (Figure 8).
This silty sandstone was darker grey in color, contained much less sandstone and held together
with a weaker calcite cementing. Hydrocarbon cuts produced a weaker diffuse cut than the
sandstone above, but still few streamers. This silty sandstone comprised the primary target zone
that we were attempting to keep the well bore in (Diagram 1).

Summary

1) The Wade 5300 21-30H was spud 5 April 2010 east of the Indian Hill Field of McKenzie
County, North Dakota. The vertical hole was drilled to a total depth (KOP) of 10,172’.

2) A mud program consisting of diesel invert (9.7 — 9.9 ppg) after surface casing and
through the curve build sections. The drilling mud was successful in maintaining stable
hole conditions and minimizing washout through the salt intervals. Brine water with a
weight of 9.4-9.5 ppg was used during lateral drilling operations to maintain hydrostatic
balance.

3) One 9 5/8” PDC bit was used to drill to surface casing at a depth of 2,025’ in 9 hours. One 8
¥%4” PDC bit was used to drill the vertical hole from surface casing to KOP of 10,172’ in a total of
5.8 hours. One 8 4” bits was used to drill through the curve, landing at a measured depth of
11,023’ in 27 hours. The entire 9,458’ lateral was drilled in 82.6 hours with one 6” PDC bits.

4) The lateral was targeting a 10’ thick section of the middle member of the Bakken
Formation situated twenty feet below the upper shale.

5) Gas levels of between 2000 and 3500 units were maintained through most of the drilling
operations. A 4-7 foot flare was maintained though most of the drilling operations

6) The Middle Bakken consisted of 2 gross lithologies. Directly below the upper Bakken Shale,
RPM geologists observed a dark gray/brown siltstone. Below this siltstone, a light grey siltstone
interbedded with light brown oil stained sandstone. The target zone consisted of light gray/
brown porous silty sandstone.

7) Hydrocarbon cuts were moderate through the entire lateral. Few slow streaming cuts were
present in target zone.

8) Drilling operations were concluded at 0115 hours on 23 APR 11 at a bottom hole location
of 23.03' S & 9971.67' E of surface location or approximately 2243.03' FNL & 311.76' FEL SE

LITHOLOGY

Rig crews caught lagged samples in 30’ intervals in the vertical hole from 8,250 to 10,710’ MD
and through the lateral from 11.020 to 19,807’ total depth (TD) with 10’ samples taken from
10,710’ to 11,020’

Electric geophysical log, sample and/or MWD gamma ray markers and tops are included in the
sample descriptions below for reference. Samples were examined wet and dry under a binocular
microscope and checked for hydrocarbon cut fluorescence with Carbo-sol (trichloroethylene) in
approximately 30’ intervals. Sample descriptions begin just above the Kibbey Lime Formation.
The drilling fluid was diesel invert during vertical and curve build sections to ICP and salt water
brine throughout the lateral to TD.

Survey Requirements for Horizontal, Horizontal Re-entry, and Directional Wells

NDAC Section 43-02-03-25 (Deviation Tests and Directional Surveys) states in part (that) the survey contractor
shall file a certified copy of all surveys with the director free of charge within thirty days of completion. Surveys
must be submitted as one electronic copy, or in a form approved by the director. However, the director may
requite the directional survey to be filed immediately after completion if the survey is needed to conduct the
operation of the director's office in a timely manner. Certified surveys must be submitted via email in one adobe

document, with a certification cover page to certsurvey@nd.gov.

Survey points shall be of such frequency to accurately determine the entire location of the well bore.

Reserve pit
Please be advised that conditions may be imposed on the use and reclamation of a drilling reserve pit on
this site if specific site conditions warrant.

Surface casing cement

Tail cement utilized on surface casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi within 12
hours, and tail cement utilized on production casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi
before drilling the plug or initiating tests.

Logs

NDAC Section 43-02-03-31 requires the running of a Cement Bond Log from which the presence of
cement can be determined in every well in which production or intermediate casing has been set and a Gamma
Ray Log must be run from total depth to ground level elevation of the well bore. All logs must be submitted as
one paper copy and one digital copy in LAS (Log ASCII) format, or a format approved by the Director. Image
logs that include, but are not limited to, Mud Logs, Cement Bond Logs, and Cyberlook Logs, cannot be produced
in their entirety as LAS (Log ASCII) files. To create a solution and establish a standard format for industry to
follow when submitting image logs, the Director has given approval for the operator to submit an image log as a
TIFF (*.tif) formatted file. The TIFF (*.tif) format will be accepted only when the log cannot be produced in its
entirety as a LAS (Log ASCII) file format. The digital copy may be submitted on a 3.5” floppy diskette, a standard

CD, or attached to an email sent to digitallogs@nd.gov

Thank you for your cooperation.

Well File # 20197

Dear Brandi:

Pursuant to Commission Order No. 14007, approval to drill the above captioned well is hereby given. The
approval is granted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than
the 1220' setback (per Commission policy) from the north & south boundaries and 200! setback (per ICO 14498)
from the east & west boundaries within the 1280 acre drilling unit consisting of Sections 29 & 30-T153N-R100W.

PERMIT STIPULATIONS: OASIS PETROLEUM must contact NDIC Field Inspector John Axtman
at 701-770-2564 prior to location construction.

New Policy

Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the
approved drilling permit on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report. If circumstances requite operations to
commence before the 3rd business day following publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may
be waived by the Director. Application for a waiver must be by sworn affidavit providing the information
necessary to evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f), and any other
information that would allow the Director to conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the
drilling permit, the applicant should retain the permit.

Permit Fee & Notification

Payment was received in the amount of $100 via credit card .The permit fee has been received. It is requested
that notification be given immediately upon the spudding of the well. This information should be relayed to the
Oil & Gas Division, Bismarck, via telephone. The following information must be included: Well name, legal
location, permit number, drilling contractor, company representative, date and time of spudding. Office hours are
8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. Central Time. Our telephone number is (701) 328-8020, leave a

NOTE: A Gamma Ray log must be run to ground surface and a CBL must be run on intermediate or longstring casing string if set.

Surveys are required at least every 30 feet in the build section and every 90 feet in the lateral section of a horizontal well. Measurement
inaccuracies are not considered when determining compliance with the spacing/drilling unit boundary setback requirement except in the
following scenarios: 1) When the angle between the well bore and the respective boundary is 10 degrees or less and the well bore is within
150 feet of the respective setback requirement; or 2) If industry standard methods and equipment are not utilized. Consult the applicable field
order for exceptions.

If measurement inaccuracies are required to be considered, a 2° MWD measurement inaccuracy will be applied to the horizontal portion of the well
bore. This measurement inaccuracy is applied to the well bore from KOP to TD.

REQUIRED ATTACHMENTS: Certified surveyor’s plat, horizontal section plat, estimated geological tops, proposed mud/cementing plan,
