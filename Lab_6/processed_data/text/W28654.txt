Synopsis

Oasis Petroleum Kline Federal 5300 41-18 13T2X [SW SW Sec. 18 T153N R1OOW] is located
~6 miles Northwest of the town of Williston, North Dakota. Kline Federal 5300 41-18 13T2X is
situated within the Baker Field. A single lateral leg trending 90° was proposed to be drilled from
the SW SW corner of Section 18 to the SE SE corner of Section 17 targeting the porous
dolostone in the second bench of the Three Forks.

Control Wells

Two completed wells were used as the control offsets to the Kline Federal 5300 41-18 13T2X.

The primary offset considered was the Kline Federal 5300 41-18 14BX [SW SW Sec. 18 T153N,
R100W] which is a horizontal well drilled by Oasis Petroleum. Kline Federal 5300 41-18 14BX
is located approximately 33 feet south of Kline Federal 5300 41-18 13T2X.

The other offset considered was the Kline Federal 5300 11-18H [SW NW Sec. 18 T153N,
R100W] which is a horizontal well drilled by Oasis Petroleum. Kline Federal 5300 11-18H is
located approximately half a mile north of Kline Federal 5300 41-18 13T2X.

During the curve, the gamma ray that was produced was constantly compared to the Kline
Federal 5300 41-18 14BX and the Kline Federal 5300 11-18H wells. Gamma ray was used to
help determine a proper landing depth.

To assist in the choosing of the landing target, an isopach table (Table 1) was constructed to
measure the distance of formation tops to the target depth determined from the Kline Federal
5300 41-18 14BX and Kline Federal 5300 11-18H offset wells. Comparison of gamma ray
markers showed the most consistent isopach for up-hole formations to be the Middle Bakken.
The same information was coalesced into a single chart (Table 2) displaying offset tops and an
average of the estimated landing point based on the offset wells. This chart was used to
corroborate the landing point, but isopach thickness was the main consideration in choosing a
landing point.

Geologic Assessment

Methods

Geologic supervision of Kline Federal 5300 41-18 13T2X was provided by experienced RPM
well site geologists. Gas and chromatograph levels were measured using NOV WellSight Gas
Detection real time gas detector and chromatograph system. The WellSight gas detection system
uses non-dispersive infrared and chemical sensor gas detection to evaluate gases liberated from
the formation by the drill bit and carried to the surface by the drilling fluid.

The gas detector was interfaced with a RigWatch electronic data recorder system. RigWatch
provided drill rate, on-off bottom and pump strokes to the gas detector and received total gas
information from the gas detector for viewing on location and remotely.

Under the direction of RPM well site geologists, rig crews were instructed to catch lagged drill
cutting samples at 30’ intervals in the vertical hole and curve build from 8,350’ to 11,200’ MD
and 50’ samples from 11,200’ to TD (20,583’).

Sampled drill cuttings were examined wet and dry under a binocular microscope using both plain
(broad spectrum) and transmitted light. Cuttings were evaluated for hydrocarbon “cut” by
immersion in Acetone and inspection under a UV fluoroscope. 10% hydrochloric acid and
alizarin red were used to determine the calcareous and dolomitic content of rocks and cementing.

RPM Geologic, Inc. (RPM) well site geologists also closely examined MWD gamma-ray
information and penetration rates to aid in steering decisions and dip degree estimations.

Vertical Operations

Overview

The Kline Federal 5300 41-18 13T2X was spud for surface drilling on 13 September 2014
utilizing Nabors 486 as the drilling contractor. Prior to commencement of RPM mud logging
services, a 17 1/2” hole was drilled with fresh water to depth of 2,159’ and isolated with 13 3/8”
36# J-55 casing cemented from 2,157' to surface. Due to uphole stability issues a second set of
casing was set. Two 12 1/2” bits were used to drill to a depth of 6,135’ and 9 5/8 40# HCL 80
casing was set @ 6,123’

RPM well site geologists began logging the vertical interval at 8,350’.

One PDC bit were used to drill out of secondary casing to vertical TD. PDC bit #1 (8 %”
Security) was used to drill from 6,135’ to 10,300’ and averaged an ROP of 61.7 ft/hr in 67.5
hours of use.

Diesel invert drilling fluid with a mud weight ranging from 9.80-10.30 ppg was used for the
remainder of the vertical hole and in the curve builds sections. The vertical interval was drilled
to a kick off point (KOP) of 10,300’, at which point vertical operations were ceased.

Lithology

The top of the Kibbey Lime [Mississippian Madison Group] was picked at 8,382’ (-6,300’),
level to the Kline Federal 5300 41-18 14BX. Samples from this interval (Figure 1) were
described as:

LIMESTONE: wackestone, medium gray, friable to hard, finely crystalline,
blocky, earthy to sucrosic, trace visible porosity

call

Figure 1: Photograph of Limestone seen in sample from the Kibby Limestone formation.

The top of the Charles Salt [Mississippian Madison Group] was logged at 8,560’ (-6,478”), 5’
low to the Kline Federal 5300 41-18 14BX. The Base Last Salt was drilled at 9,206’ (-7,124’),
1’ low to the Kline Federal 5300 41-18 14BX. Samples from this interval (Figure 2) were
described as:

SALT: translucent, trace off white, crystalline, firm, crystalline texture, no visible
porosity, no visible oil stain

LIMESTONE: mudstone, light gray to medium gray, off white to cream,
microcrystalline, soft to fair, chalky to crystalline texture, trace intercrystalline

porosity, slightly light brown oil stain

ANHYDRITE: off white, cream, soft to firm, amorphous texture, no visible porosity

Directional Operations

Gyrodata provided equipment and personnel for MWD teams, while RPM Consulting provided
directional personnel. RPM geologists worked closely with RPM directional as well as Gyrodata
MWD teams to formulate steering decisions to maximize the footage of borehole in the pay
zone.

Curve Build
Overview
One PDC bits was used to build the curve section. Bit #4 was an 8 %4’’ SEC MMDS55C bit used

to drill the curve from a measured depth of 10,300’ to 11,150’ in 32.0 hours, averaging 27.66
ft/hr. 7” 32# P-110 29 Ibs casing was set to 10,700’ MD upon completion of the curve.

A Chart was constructed for the curve (Chart 1) that compared the isopach of certain easily
recognizable gamma markers from the Kibbey Lime to the Middle Bakken on the control well
Kline Federal 5300 41-18 14BX to the Kline Federal 5300 11-1SH as marker picks were made.
This chart shows the Middle Bakken top being the closest in thickness to target based on the
offset well, and was the main point used to make changes to the target landing depth during the
curve. A table (Table 2) was constructed comparing Kline Federal 5300 41-18 13T2X to the
offset formation tops as well as an average of the estimated landing point based on the offset
wells. This chart was used to corroborate the landing point, but isopach thickness was the main
consideration in choosing a landing point. The curve was completed at a measured depth of
11,185’and TVD of 10,852’, ~25 feet into the second bench of the Three Forks.

Gas and hydrocarbon Shows

It was found that the gas in the Three Forks Ist Bench averaged 40-90 units throughout the target
zone with peaks of 160 units. In the claystone below the target zone gas levels averaged 30
units.

Hydrocarbon cuts using Entron solvent were moderate though the entire lateral. The target zone
and above was characterized by moderate fast white to yellow diffuse cuts and common fast
streaming cuts. No correlation was found between the strength of the hydrocarbon cuts and the
position of the bit in the dolomite 1st Bench Three Forks.

8)

The Kline Federal 5300 41-18 13T2X was initially spud for surface drilling on 17th of
September 2014 in the Indian Hills field of McKenzie County, North Dakota. The well
was spud by Nabors 486 and the vertical hole was drilled to a total depth (KOP) of
10,300’.

A mud program consisted of diesel invert (10.3-11.6 ppg) after surface casing through the
curve build sections. The drilling mud was successful in maintaining stable hole
conditions and minimizing washout through the salt intervals. Brine water with a weight
of 9.8-9.9 ppg was used during lateral drilling operations to maintain hydrostatic balance
until a TD of 20,760’.

One 8 %” Haliburton PDC bit was used to drill out of surface casing to a KOP of
10,300’. One 8 *%4” PDC bit was used to drill the curve to 11,185’ MD. One 6” PDC bit
was used to drill the lateral to 20,760’ TD.

The lateral was targeting the Three Forks member ranging from about 8’ below the base
of the Pronghorn down to approximately 1’ above the Claystone.

Gas levels between 40 and 100 units and peaks as high as 160 units were maintained
through the lateral drilling operations while in the Three Forks.

The Three Forks target consisted of one observed gross lithology. The Three Forks was
observed to be a dolostone with lots of disseminated pyrite and apparent intergranular
porosity.

Trace to moderate oil stain was observed in zone associated with a fast, white, diffuse
cut. Trace oil washed out of the samples into the wash water when they were cleaned.

Drilling operations were concluded at 14:00 on Febuary 7", 2015 at a bottom hole
location of 10,022.35' E & 599.11'S of surface location or approximately 198.11' FNL &
280.4' FEL of NE NE Sec. 20, T153N, R1OOW.

Kline Federal 41-18 18T2X LITHOLOGY

Geologists caught lagged samples in 30’ intervals in the vertical hole, from 8,350’ to 10,300’ MD; 30”
intervals in the curve build from 10,300’ to 11,190’ MD; and 50’ samples in the lateral from 11,190’ to
TD at 20,760’

Electric geophysical log, sample and/or MWD gamma ray markers and tops are included in the sample
descriptions below for reference. Samples were examined wet and dry under a binocular microscope in
approximately 30’ to 50’ intervals. Sample descriptions begin in the Kibbey formation. The drilling fluid
was diesel invert in the vertical and curve, and salt water brine in the lateral.

DETAILS OF WORK

Oasis Petroleum North America LLC requests permission for suspension of drilling for up to 90 days for the
referenced well under NDAC 43-02-03-55. Oasis Petroleum North America LLC intends to drill the surface hole with
freshwater based drilling mud and set surface casing with a small drilling rig and move off within 3 to 5 days. The
casing will be set at a depth pre-approved by the NDIC per the Application for Permit to Drill NDAC 43-02-03-21. No
saltwater will be used in the drilling and cementing operations of the surface casing. Once the surface casing is
cemented, a plug or mechanical seal will be placed at the top of the casing to prevent any foreign matter from getting
into the well. A rig capable of drilling to TD will move onto the location within the 90 days previously outlined to
complete the drilling and casing plan as per the APD. The undersigned states that this request for suspension of
drilling operations in accordance with the Subsection 4 of Section 43-02-03-55 of the NDAC, is being requested to
take advantage of the cost savings and time savings of using an initial rig that is smaller than the rig necessary to
drill a well to total depth but is not intended to alter or extend the terms and conditions of, or suspend any obligation
under, any oil and gas lease with acreage in or under the spacing or drilling unit for the above-referenced well. Oasis
Petroleum North America LLC understands NDAC 43-02-03-31 requirements regarding confidentiality pertaining to
this permit. The drilling pit will be fenced immediately after construction if the well pad is located in a pasture (NDAC
43-02-03-19 & 19.1). Oasis Petroleum North America LL will plug and abandon the well and reclaim the well site if the
well is not drilled by the larger rotary rig within 90 days after spudding the well with the smaller drilling rig.

RE: Filter Socks and Other Filter Media
Leakproof Container Required
Oil and Gas Wells

Dear Operator,

North Dakota Administrative Code Section 43-02-03-19.2 states in part that all waste material associated with
exploration or production of oil and gas must be properly disposed of in an authorized facility in accord with all
applicable local, state, and federal laws and regulations.

Filtration systems are commonly used during oil and gas operations in North Dakota. The Commission is very
concerned about the proper disposal of used filters (including filter socks) used by the oil and gas industry.

Effective June 1, 2014, a container must be maintained on each well drilled in North Dakota beginning when the
well is spud and must remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations
are conducted. The on-site container must be used to store filters until they can be properly disposed of in an
authorized facility. Such containers must be:

e leakproof to prevent any fluids from escaping the container

e covered to prevent precipitation from entering the container

e placard to indicate only filters are to be placed in the container

If the operator will not utilize a filtration system, a waiver to the container requirement will be considered, but
only upon the operator submitting a Sundry Notice (Form 4) justifying their request.

As previously stated in our March 13, 2014 letter, North Dakota Administrative Code Section 33-20-02.1-01
states in part that every person who transports solid waste (which includes oil and gas exploration and production
wastes) is required to have a valid permit issued by the North Dakota Department of Health, Division of Waste
Management. Please contact the Division of Waste Management at (701) 328-5166 with any questions on the
solid waste program. Note oil and gas exploration and production wastes include produced water, drilling mud,
invert mud, tank bottom sediment, pipe scale, filters, and fly ash.

Thank you for your cooperation.

Sincerely,

Brace E. Fichs
