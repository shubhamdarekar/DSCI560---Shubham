Synopsis

Oasis Petroleum Kline Federal 5300 41-18 9T [SW SW Sec. 18 T153N R10O0W] is located ~6
miles Northwest of the town of Williston, North Dakota. Kline Federal 5300 41-18 9T is situated
within the Baker Field. A single lateral leg trending 90° was proposed to be drilled from the SW
SW corner of Section 18 to the SE SE corner of Section 17 targeting the porous dolostone in the
first bench of the Three Forks.

Control Wells

Two completed wells were used as the control offsets to the Kline Federal 5300 41-18 9T.

The primary offset considered was the Kline Federal 5300 41-18 11T2 [SW SW Sec. 18 T153N,
R100W] which is a horizontal well drilled by Oasis Petroleum. Kline Federal 5300 41-18 11T2
is located approximately 66 feet south of Kline Federal 5300 41-18 9T.

The other offset considered was the Kline Federal 5300 41-18 10B [SW SW Sec. 18 T153N,
R100W] which is a horizontal well drilled by Oasis Petroleum. Kline Federal 5300 41-18 10B is
located approximately 33 feet south of Kline Federal 5300 41-18 9T.

During the curve, the gamma ray that was produced was constantly compared to the Kline
Federal 5300 41-18 11T2 and the Kline Federal 5300 41-18 10B wells. Gamma ray was used to
help determine a proper landing depth.

To assist in the choosing of the landing target, an isopach table (Table 1) was constructed to
measure the distance of formation tops to the target depth determined from the Kline Federal
5300 41-18 11T2 and Kline Federal 5300 41-18 10B offset wells. Comparison of gamma ray
markers showed the most consistent isopach for up-hole formations to be the Middle Bakken.

Geologic Assessment

Methods

Geologic supervision of Kline Federal 5300 41-18 9T was provided by experienced RPM well
site geologists. Gas and chromatograph levels were measured using NOV WellSight Gas
Detection real time gas detector and chromatograph system. The WellSight gas detection system
uses non-dispersive infrared and chemical sensor gas detection to evaluate gases liberated from
the formation by the drill bit and carried to the surface by the drilling fluid.

The gas detector was interfaced with a Rig Watch electronic data recorder system. Rig Watch
provided drill rate, on-off bottom and pump strokes to the gas detector and received total gas
information from the gas detector for viewing on location and remotely.

Under the direction of RPM well site geologists, rig crews were instructed to catch lagged drill
cutting samples at 30’ intervals in the vertical hole and curve build from 8,350’ to 11,177’ MD
and 50’ samples from 11,177’ to TD (20,742’).

Sampled drill cuttings were examined wet and dry under a binocular microscope using both plain
(broad spectrum) and transmitted light. Cuttings were evaluated for hydrocarbon “cut” by
immersion in Acetone and inspection under a UV fluoroscope. 10% hydrochloric acid and
alizarin red were used to determine the calcareous and dolomitic content of rocks and cementing.

RPM Geologic, Inc. (RPM) well site geologists also closely examined MWD gamma-ray
information and penetration rates to aid in steering decisions and dip degree estimations.

Vertical Operations

Overview

The Kline Federal 5300 41-18 9T was spud for surface drilling on 24 August 2014 utilizing
Nabors 486 as the drilling contractor. Prior to commencement of RPM mud logging services, a
13 1/2” hole was drilled with fresh water to depth of 2,140’ and isolated with 9 5/8” 36# J-55
casing cemented from 2,122' to surface.

RPM well site geologists began logging the vertical interval at 8,350’.

Three PDC bits were used to drill out of surface casing to vertical TD. Bit #1 was a 17 4 NOV
bit. PDC bit #2 (12 1/4” Varel 40007781) was used to drill from 2,185’ to 6,150’ and averaged
an ROP of 141.61 ft/hr in 28 hours of use. 9.625” J55 36 lbs casing was set to 6,138’ MD due
to Dakota Formation being over pressured in this area. PDC bit #3 (8 4” Smith MDSI616) was
used to drill from 6,150’ to 9,962’ and averaged an ROP of 64.60 ft/hr in 59.0 hours of use. PDC
bit #4 (8 %4” Smith MDSI616) was used to drill from 9,962’ to 10,330’ and averaged an ROP of
73.60 over 5 hours of use.

ARGILLACEOUS LIMESTONE: wackestone, medium gray brown to light gray
brown, firm, crystalline texture, trace sparry calcareous, carbonaceous, possible
intercrystalline porosity, possible slightly light brown spotty oil stain

Directional Operations

Gyrodata provided equipment and personnel for MWD teams, while RPM Consulting provided
directional personnel. RPM geologists worked closely with RPM directional as well as Gyrodata
MWD teams to formulate steering decisions to maximize the footage of borehole in the pay
zone.

Curve Build
Overview

One PDC bits was used to build the curve section. Bit #5 was an 8 %4” Security MMDS5SC bit
used to drill the curve from a measured depth of 10,330’ to 11,177’ in 27.5 hours, averaging
30.80 ft/hr. 7” P-110 32# casing was set to 11,162’ MD upon completion of the curve.

A Chart was constructed for the curve (Chart 1) that compared the isopach of certain easily
recognizable gamma markers from the Kibbey Lime to Three Forks on the control wells Kline
Federal 5300 41-18 11T2 and Kline 5300 41-18 10B to the Kline Federal 5300 41-18 9T as
marker picks were made. This chart shows the Middle Bakken top being the closest in

thickness to target based on the offset well, and was the main point used to make changes to the
target landing depth during the curve. A table (Table 2) was constructed comparing Kline
Federal 5300 41-18 9T to the offset formation tops as well as an average of the estimated
landing point based on the offset wells. This chart was used to corroborate the landing point, but
isopach thickness was the main consideration in choosing a landing point. The curve was
completed at a measured depth of 11,177’and TVD of 10,821’, ~20 feet below the base of the
Three Forks.

Overview

Drilling fluid consisting of open system salt water brine (9.6-9.8 ppg) was used while drilling the
lateral section up to the TD of 20,742’. Five 6” PDC bits were used to drill the lateral.

Bit #6 (Smith JJ4130) was a PDC bit used to drill the start of the lateral from 11,177’ to 11,577’
and averaged an ROP of 32 ft/hr over 12.5 hours of use. Bit #7 (Varel) was a PDC bit used to
drill from 11,577’ to 16,933’; it was used for 102.5 hours at an average drilling rate of 52.25 feet
per hour. Bit #8 (Varel VM613P2) was a PDC bit used to drill from 16,933’ to 19,195’, and was
used for 34 hours and averaged an ROP of 66.53 ft/hr. Bit #9 (Varel VM613P2) was used to drill
from 19,195’ to TD of 20,742’; it was used for 30 hours with an average ROP of 51.57 ft/hr.

The Kline Federal 5300 41-18 9T was initially spud for surface drilling on 9th of
November 2014 in the Indian hills McKinley County, North Dakota. The well was spud
by Nabors 486 and the vertical hole was drilled to a total depth (KOP) of 10,330’.

A mud program consisted of diesel invert (9.8-10.8 ppg) after surface casing through the
curve build sections. The drilling mud was successful in maintaining stable hole
conditions and minimizing washout through the salt intervals. Brine water with a weight
of 9.6-9.7 ppg was used during lateral drilling operations to maintain hydrostatic balance
until a TD of 20,742’.

One 12 1/4” Varel PDC bit was used to drill out of surface casing to a vertical depth of
2,185. 2 Smith 8 % bits were used to drill to KOP of 10,330’. One 8 %4” PDC bit was
used to drill the curve to 11,177’ MD. Six 5” PDC bits were used to drill the lateral to
21,050’ TD.

The lateral was targeting the Three Forks member ranging from about 20’ below the
base of the Pronghorn down to approximately 1’ above the Claystone.

Gas levels between 400 and 1000 units with peaks over 2000 units were maintained
through the target zone of the lateral drilling operations while in the Three Forks.

The Three Forks target consisted of one observed gross lithology. The Three Forks was
observed to be a dolostone with lots of disseminated pyrite and apparent intergranular
porosity.

Trace to moderate oil stain was observed in zone associated with a fast, white, diffuse
cut. Trace oil washed out of the samples into the wash water when they were cleaned.

Drilling operations were concluded on December 16", 2014 at a bottom hole location of
9998.39 ' E & 732.43' S of surface location or approximately 1265.43' FSL & 253.79"
FEL of SE SE Sec. 17, T153N-R1O00W.

Lithology

The target Zone of the Three Forks consisted of a dolostone with very apparent intergranular
porosity, moderate gas, and moderate to abundant oil show. Samples from the target Zone were
generally described as:

DOLOMITE: mudstone, light to medium gray, very fine
crystalline, firm, earthy texture, trace silty, trace very fine
sand, trace intercrystalline porosity, trace disseminated and
nodular pyrite, trace spotty light brown oil stain

Gas and hydrocarbon Shows

It was found that the gas and hydrocarbon shows were a fair indicator of placement in Zone
throughout the lateral. While drilling in the target Dolomite gas levels maintained average levels
of 800 to 900 units with peaks over 2300 units. When the bit dropped in vertical position into
the claystone gas levels dropped to under 100 units with peaks nearing 300 units.

The Bloodhound gas chromatograph showed components of all C1-C4 present through the lateral
while drilling in the target zone. C1 was primarily present while drilling in the claystone below.
Sample cuttings throughout the lateral showed oil stain and a fast white diffuse cut when
submerged in Acetone solution and observed with a UV fluoroscope. Trace oil was observed in
the sample wash water.

line Federal 5300 41-18 9T LITHOLOGY

Rig crews caught lagged samples in 30’ intervals in the vertical hole, curve build and landing from 8,350’
to 11,177’ MD; 50’ samples were caught in the lateral from 11,177’ to TD at 20,742’.

Sample and/or MWD gamma ray markers and tops are included in the sample descriptions below for
reference. Samples were examined wet and dry under a binocular microscope in approximately 30’ to 50’
intervals. Sample descriptions begin in the Tyler formation. The drilling fluid was diesel invert during
vertical and curve build sections and salt water brine in the lateral to TD.

Dear Heather:

Pursuant to Commission Order No. 23752, approval to drill the above captioned well is hereby given. The
approval is granted on the condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than
the 500' setback from the north & south boundaries and 200' setback from the east & west boundaries within the
1280 acre spacing unit consisting of Sections 18 & 17 T153N R100W.

PERMIT STIPULATIONS: Due to the proximity of Lake Sakakawea to the well site, a dike is required
surrounding the entire location. Effective June 1, 2014, a covered leak-proof container (with placard) for
filter sock disposal must be maintained on the well site beginning when the well is spud, and must
remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations are
conducted. OASIS PETRO NO AMER must contact NDIC Field Inspector Richard Dunn at 701-770-
3554 prior to location construction.

Drilling pit

NDAC 43-02-03-19.4 states that “a pit may be utilized to bury drill cuttings and solids generated during well
drilling and completion operations, providing the pit can be constructed, used and reclaimed in a manner that will
prevent pollution of the land surface and freshwaters. Reserve and circulation of mud system through earthen pits
are prohibited. All pits shall be inspected by an authorized representative of the director prior to lining and use.
Drill cuttings and solids must be stabilized in a manner approved by the director prior to placement in a cuttings

pit.”

Form 1 Changes & Hard Lines

Any changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC.
The proposed directional plan is at a legal location. Based on the azimuth of the proposed lateral the maximum

DETAILS OF WORK

Oasis Petroleum North America LLC requests permission for suspension of drilling for up to 90 days for the
referenced well under NDAC 43-02-03-55. Oasis Petroleum North America LLC intends to drill the surface hole with
freshwater based drilling mud and set surface casing with a small drilling rig and move off within 3 to 5 days. The
casing will be set at a depth pre-approved by the NDIC per the Application for Permit to Drill NDAC 43-02-03-21. No
saltwater will be used in the drilling and cementing operations of the surface casing. Once the surface casing is
cemented, a plug or mechanical seal will be placed at the top of the casing to prevent any foreign matter from getting
into the well. A rig capable of drilling to TD will move onto the location within the 90 days previously outlined to
complete the drilling and casing plan as per the APD. The undersigned states that this request for suspension of
drilling operations in accordance with the Subsection 4 of Section 43-02-03-55 of the NDAC, is being requested to
take advantage of the cost savings and time savings of using an initial rig that is smaller than the rig necessary to
drill a well to total depth but is not intended to alter or extend the terms and conditions of, or suspend any obligation
under, any oil and gas lease with acreage in or under the spacing or drilling unit for the above-referenced well. Oasis
Petroleum North America LLC understands NDAC 43-02-03-31 requirements regarding confidentiality pertaining to
this permit. The drilling pit will be fenced immediately after construction if the well pad is located in a pasture (NDAC
43-02-03-19 & 19.1). Oasis Petroleum North America LL will plug and abandon the well and reclaim the well site if the
well is not drilled by the larger rotary rig within 90 days after spudding the well with the smaller drilling rig.

RE: Filter Socks and Other Filter Media
Leakproof Container Required
Oil and Gas Wells

Dear Operator,

North Dakota Administrative Code Section 43-02-03-19.2 states in part that all waste material associated with
exploration or production of oil and gas must be properly disposed of in an authorized facility in accord with all
applicable local, state, and federal laws and regulations.

Filtration systems are commonly used during oil and gas operations in North Dakota. The Commission is very
concerned about the proper disposal of used filters (including filter socks) used by the oil and gas industry.

Effective June 1, 2014, a container must be maintained on each well drilled in North Dakota beginning when the
well is spud and must remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations
are conducted. The on-site container must be used to store filters until they can be properly disposed of in an
authorized facility. Such containers must be:

e leakproof to prevent any fluids from escaping the container

e covered to prevent precipitation from entering the container

e placard to indicate only filters are to be placed in the container

If the operator will not utilize a filtration system, a waiver to the container requirement will be considered, but
only upon the operator submitting a Sundry Notice (Form 4) justifying their request.

As previously stated in our March 13, 2014 letter, North Dakota Administrative Code Section 33-20-02.1-01
states in part that every person who transports solid waste (which includes oil and gas exploration and production
wastes) is required to have a valid permit issued by the North Dakota Department of Health, Division of Waste
Management. Please contact the Division of Waste Management at (701) 328-5166 with any questions on the
solid waste program. Note oil and gas exploration and production wastes include produced water, drilling mud,
invert mud, tank bottom sediment, pipe scale, filters, and fly ash.

Thank you for your cooperation.

Sincerely,

Brace E. Fichs
