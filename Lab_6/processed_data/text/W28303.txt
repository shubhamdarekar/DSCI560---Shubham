Using the aforementioned information gathered during drilling, offset log information and
the structural data provided from Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC., well site geologists
were able to anticipate, and interpret the local apparent dip during the drilling of the Wade
Federal 5300 31-30 11T well. A total depth of 20,500’ MD was reached on January 18, 2015
at 13:45 CDT. The target resultant was 100% within the Three Forks Formation. The
resulting structure of the Three Forks was a drop in TVD of 86.80’ over 9,525’ MD;
resulting in an overall down dip of 0.52° as portrayed on the Wade Federal 5300 31-30 11T
dip profile (Figure 10).

Figure 3 & 4: Wet cutting of the Lodgepole Formation (left) and False Bakken sub-interval (right) at 10X.

The top of the Lodgepole Formation was logged at 9,921’ TVD (-7,867’). In general the
Lodgepole can be described as a medium to dark gray brown argillaceous lime mudstone with a
crystalline texture and trace amounts of disseminated pyrite (Figure 3). The False Bakken
(Carrington Shale), drilled at 10,648’ TVD (-8,594’), is comprised of very dark brown to black,
slightly pyritic shale with an earthy texture, and was found to be soft to firm (Figure 4). Strong
hydrocarbon shows in the lower 100’ of the Lodgepole were as high as 158 total gas units;
suggest that some of the oil and gas from the Upper Bakken Shale may be exploiting fractures
thought to exist in the Lower Lodgepole.

The Bakken Formation (Devonian — Mississippian) has four formal members, an upper and
lower black, fissile, organic-rich pyritic shale, separated by an arenaceous limestone, siltstone
and silty sandstone middle member. These three members overlay a silty shale or siltstone of the
Pronghorn Member toward the basin depositional center. The Upper Bakken Shale was drilled at
10,656’ TVD (-8,602’) with sample returns typically described as black, carbonaceous,
petroliferous shale with trace amounts of disseminated pyrite (Figure 5). The Middle Bakken,
penetrated at 10,673’ TVD (-8,619”), consists of a varying thickness and sequence of interbedded
siltstone, limestone and silty sandstone. Trace spotty light brown oil staining was present along
with gas shows as high as 456 TGU. This light brown spotty oil staining was common.
Penetrated at 10,711’ TVD (-8,657’), the Lower Bakken Shale was described as a black to dark
brown carbonaceous shale with trace amounts of disseminated pyrite (Figure 6). Gas shows
encountered in the Lower Bakken read as high as 1356u (C1-C4). The Pronghorn was penetrated
at 10,718’ TVD (-8,664’) and is commonly described as a dark to medium gray siltstone with
calcite cement.

GEOLOGIC EVALUATION
Methods:

Geologic supervision of the Wade Federal 5300 31-30 11T was provided by Sunburst
Consulting, Inc. with two well site geologists. A digital gas detector and chromatograph were
interfaced with a Pason electronic data recorder system. The unit of measure for gas on this well
was units (u), which was defined as 100 units equaling 1% methane equivalent in air. The EDR
provided drill rate, on-off bottom and pump strokes to the gas detection computer and received
total gas information from Sunburst for viewing around location. Lagged samples were caught
by the rig crew in 30’ intervals from 4,600’ MD to 10,870’ MD, 10’ intervals from 10,870’ MD
to 11,080’ MD, and 30’ intervals from 11,080’ MD to 20,500’ TD. Wet and dry cuttings were
examined under a tri-ocular microscope and complete lithologic descriptions and sampling
intervals are provided in the lithology document within this evaluation. The set of dry cuttings
collected during the duration of the well were sent to the State of North Dakota. Evidence of
light hydrocarbons present in the drilling fluid was reported by the gas chromatography
equipment and documented on the mud log presented with this report.

Zones of Interest:

The Mission Canyon Formation (Mississippian; Madison Group) was drilled at 9,364’ TVD
(-7,310’) and is comprised largely of light gray lime mudstone followed by gray to tan earthy
textured argillaceous lime mudstone. Shows within the Mission Canyon ranged from 15 to 100
units against 9.8 ppg mud.

The Three Forks Formation (Devonian; Kaskaskia Sequence.) represents a regressive sequence
deposited in a supratidal sabkha environment. The top of the Three Forks was drilled at 10,736’
TVD (-8,682’) and is comprised of a light to medium gray, cream to off white sucrosic dolomite
with trace to occasional amounts of disseminated pyrite and light green shale also with trace
amounts of disseminated pyrite (Figure 8). Shows within the Three Forks Formation ranged from
50 to 431 units in a drilling mud of 9.6-9.9 ppg.

Figure 7 & 8: Wet cuttings of the Three Forks dolomite and shale (left and right) at 10X.

Geo-steering:

Kick-off point for the curve was established from the isopach of the “base last salt” marker
to the Three Forks “target” in the offset wells. The Chalmers 5300 31-30 12T was used as the
primary offset through the vertical and curve sections. While drilling the curve, measured
gamma ray signatures were compared to those of the three offsets and aided in the landing of
the curve. The landing target was confirmed by the depth of the False Bakken, which was
consistent with the offset wells. The curve was successfully landed within the Three Forks
Formation at a depth of 11,080’ MD (10,753’ TVD) placing the well bore approximately 17’
below the top of the Three Forks Formation. Directional tools were then pulled out of the
hole and a string of 7” casing was set (11,060’ MD) and then cemented by Schlumberger.

Samples from the target zone varied in porosity, oil staining, color, cementation, and pyrite
content. Stratigraphic location in the target zone was based on these sample observations
along with gas shows, drill rates and gamma ray values. Severe doglegs were to be avoided
so as to obtain the desired vertical section and aid in a successful completion liner run at TD.

The Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC prospect geologist defined the an initial target
zone as an 10’ zone that began 18’ below the top of the Three Forks Formation and ended at
the claystone member 28’ below the Three Forks Formation. The upper target zone consisted
of a dolomite and shale interval reading 90-120 count gamma (A marker). The center of the
target interval was comprised of a warmer dolomite with greater amounts of shale reading
100-140 count gamma (B marker). The base of the target zone was characterized by a clean
dolomite with trace amounts of shale with gamma readings of 35-90 (C marker). The A-C
gamma markers were used for determining depth within the target interval and plotted on the
Wade Federal 5300 31-30 11T dip profile (Figure 10).

Hydrocarbons:

Gas monitoring and fluid gains were monitored to evaluate the viability of this reservoir during
the drilling of the Wade Federal 5300 31-30 11T well. In the invert mud system, hydrostatic
conditions were maintained near balance. This allowed for gas and fluid gains from the well to
be monitored. Gas shows were encountered in vertical, curve and lateral drilling of the well.

Background gas observed during the drilling of the lateral ranged from 50 to 120 units. Invert
drilling fluid was used throughout the drilling of the vertical and curve weighing 9.8-10.0 ppg.
The lateral was drilled with saline drilling fluid with a mud weight of 9.6-9.9 ppg. Gas shows
ranged up to 438 units and connection gases were observed up to 359 units. Cl-C4 gas
components were observed throughout the course of the lateral. Trip gases were observed as high
as 1,482 units. Oil shows were very light throughout the lateral ranging from 0-3% in sample.
When present it was a light brown spotty oil stain that yielded a slow to moderate streaming to
diffuse light green cut fluorescence.

SUMMARY

The Nabors B25 drilling rig successfully drilled a two-section horizontal well bore within the
Three Forks Formation at the Wade Federal 5300 31-30 11T. A net of 9,525’ was drilled within
the Three Forks. A mud program consisting of diesel invert (9.8 — 10.0 ppg), during the vertical
and curve build sections, and salt water based mud (9.6 -9.9 ppg), during the lateral maintained
stable hole conditions and permitted adequate analysis of gas concentrations.

Projections of dip were successfully used to maintain the well bore in the Three Forks Formation
target zone for 86% of the lateral. Samples from the target consisted of a light to medium gray,
cream to off white dolomite with trace to occasional amounts of disseminated pyrite and
light green shale also with trace amounts of disseminated pyrite. Intercrystalline porosity was
generally seen throughout the entire lateral. Hydrocarbon shows in the target zone were high
throughout the lateral. Samples from the ideal zone contained a spotty light brown oil stain.

The Wade Federal 5300 31-30 11T will be fitted with a 4 %” production liner and swell packers
in preparation for a fracture stimulation that will determine the true commercial value of the
well. The well currently awaits fracture stimulation.

LITHOLOGY

Rig crews caught lagged samples in 30’ and 10’ intervals under the supervision of Sunburst geologists. A detailed list of
sampling intervals is included in the well data summary page. Sample or gamma ray marker tops have been inserted in the
sample descriptions below for reference. Samples were examined wet and dry under a trinocular microscope. The drilling
fluid was diesel-based invert from surface casing to intermediate casing, while salt water drilling fluid was used throughout
the lateral. Sample collection began at 4,600’ MD.

DETAILS OF WORK

Oasis Petroleum North America LLC requests permission for suspension of drilling for up to 90 days for the
referenced well under NDAC 43-02-03-55. Oasis Petroleum North America LLC intends to drill the surface hole with
freshwater based drilling mud and set surface casing with a small drilling rig and move off within 3 to 5 days. The
casing willl be set at a depth pre-approved by the NDIC per the Application for Permit to Drill NDAC 43-02-03-21. No
saltwater will be used In the drilling and cementing operations of the surface casing. Once the surface casing is
cemented, a plug or mechanical seal willl be placed at the top of the casing to prevent any foreign matter from getting
into the well. A rlg capable of drilling to TD will move onto the location within the 90 days previously outlined to
complete the drilllng and casing plan as per the APD. The undersigned states that this request for suspension of
drilllng operations in accordance with the Subsection 4 of Section 43-02-03-55 of the NDAC, is being requested to
take advantage of the cost savings and time savings of using an initial rig that is smailer than the rlg necessary to
drill a well to total depth but Is not intended to alter or extend the terms and conditions of, or suspend any obligation
under, any oll and gas lease with acreage in or under the spacing or drilling unit for the above-referenced well. Oasis
Petroleum North America LLC understands NDAC 43-02-03-31 requirements regarding confidentlality pertaining to
this permit. The driliing pit will be fenced immediately after construction if the well pad is located in a pasture (NDAC
43-02-03-19 & 19.1). Oasis Petroleum North America LL will plug and abandon the well and reclaim the well site if the

At minimum, the BOP equipment will be pressure tested after initial installation, after running intermediate
casing, after any repairs to the equipment and at least once every 30 days.

Pipe and blind rams will be activated on each trip, annular preventer will be activated weekly and weekly
BOP drills will be held with each crew. All BOP drills and tests will be recorded in the IADC driller’s log.

Choke Manifold Equipment:

All choke lines will be straight lines. Whenever possible a turns, tee blocks will be used or will be targeted
with running tees, and will be anchored to prevent whip and vibration.

Accumulator System and Location of Hydraulic Controls:

The accumulator will have sufficient capacity to open the hydraulically controlled choke line valve (if so
equipped), close all rams plus the annular preventer, and retain a minimum of 200 psi above pre-charge
on the closing manifold without the use of the closing unit pumps. The fluid reservoir capacity will be
double the accumulator capacity and the fluid level will be maintained at the manufacturer's
recommendations. The BOP system will have two (2) independent power sources to close the
preventers. Nitrogen bottles (3 minimum) will be one (1) of these independent power sources and will
maintain a charge equal to the manufacturer's specifications.

The accumulator pre-charge pressure test will be conducted prior to connecting the closing unit to the
BOP stack and at least once every six (6) months thereafter. The accumulator pressure will be corrected
if the measured pre-charge pressure is found to be above or below the maximum or minimum limits
specified in Onshore Oil & Gas Order Number 2.

Auxiliary Equipment:

A) Mud logger with gas monitor -8273’ (200’ above Charles Salt to Intermediate TD)

B) Choke manifold with one manual and one hydraulic operated choke
C) Full opening floor valve with drill pipe thread

D) Upper and lower Kelly cock

E) Shale shakers and possible mud cleaner.

_ Miscellaneous Information:

Nabors B25 is being considered to be used at the proposed location. Operations will commence after
approval of this application.

The blowout preventer and related pressure control equipment will be installed, tested and maintained in
compliance with the specifications in and requirements of Onshore Oil & Gas Order Number 2.

The choke manifold and BOP extension rods with hand wheels will be located outside the rig
substructure. The hydraulic BOP closing unit will be located at least twenty five (25) feet from the
wellhead but readily accessible to the driller Exact locations and configurations of the hydraulic BOP
closing unit will depend upon the particular rig contracted to drill this well.

A flare line will be installed after the choke manifold, connecting the manifold to a separate flare tank
located at least 125 feet away from the wellbore and any existing production facilities.

Anticipated bottom hole temperature is 264° F.

Survey Requirements for Horizontal, Horizontal Re-entry, and Directional Wells

NDAC Section 43-02-03-25 (Deviation Tests and Directional Surveys) states in part (that) the survey contractor shall file a certified copy
of all surveys with the director free of charge within thirty days of completion. Surveys must be submitted as one electronic copy, or in a
form approved by the director. However, the director may require the directional survey to be filed immediately after completion if the
sutvey is needed to conduct the operation of the director's office in a timely manner. Certified surveys must be submitted via email in one
adobe document, with a certification cover page to certsurvey@nd.gov.
Survey points shall be of such frequency to accurately determine the entire location of the well bore.
Specifically, the Horizontal and Directional well survey frequency is 100 feet in the vertical, 30 feet in the curve (or when sliding) and 90
feet in the lateral.

Surface casing cement
Tail cement utilized on surface casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi within 12 hours, and tail cement
utilized on production casing must have a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi before drilling the plug or initiating tests.

Logs

NDAC Section 43-02-03-31 requires the running of (1) a suite of open hole logs from which formation tops and porosity zones
can be determined, (2) a Gamma Ray Log run from total depth to ground level elevation of the well bore, and (3) a log from which the
presence and quality of cement can be determined (Standard CBL or Ultrasonic cement evaluation log) in every well in which production
or intermediate casing has been set, this log must be run prior to completing the well. All logs run must be submitted free of charge, as
one digital TIFF (tagged image file format) copy and one digital LAS (log ASCII) formatted copy. Digital logs may be submitted on a
standard CD, DVD, or attached to an email sent to digitallogs@nd.gov

Thank you for your cooperation.

RE: HORIZONTAL WELL
WADE FEDERAL 5300 31-30 11T
LOT3 Section 30-153N-100W
McKenzie County
Well File # 28303

Dear Brandi:

Pursuant to Commission Order No. 23752, approval to drill the above captioned well is hereby given. The approval is granted on the
condition that all portions of the well bore not isolated by cement, be no closer than the 500' setback from the north & south boundaries
and 200" setback from the east & west boundaries within the 1280 acre spacing unit consisting of Sections 29 & 30 T153N R100W. Tool
error is not required pursuant to order.

PERMIT STIPULATIONS: Effective June 1, 2014, a covered leak-proof container (with placard) for filter sock disposal must
be maintained on the well site beginning when the well is spud, and must remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and
flow-back whenever filtration operations are conducted. OASIS PETROLEUM NORTH AMERICA LLC must take into
consideration NDAC 43-02-03-28 (Safety Regulation) when contemplating simultaneous operations on the above captioned
location. Pursuant to NDAC 43-02-03-28 (Safety Regulation) “No boiler, portable electric lighting generator, or treater shall be
placed nearer than 150 feet to any producing well or oil tank.” Due to drainage adjacent to the well site, a dike is required
surrounding the entire location. Remote pit is NOT approved at this time. OASIS PETRO NO AMER must contact NDIC
Field Inspector Richard Dunn at 701-770-3554 prior to location construction.

Drilling pit

NDAC 43-02-03-19.4 states that “a pit may be utilized to bury drill cuttings and solids generated during well drilling and completion
operations, providing the pit can be constructed, used and reclaimed in a manner that will prevent pollution of the land surface and
freshwaters. Reserve and circulation of mud system through earthen pits are prohibited. All pits shall be inspected by an authorized
representative of the director prior to lining and use. Drill cuttings and solids must be stabilized in a manner approved by the director
prior to placement in a cuttings pit.”

Form 1 Changes & Hard Lines
Any changes, shortening of casing point or lengthening at Total Depth must have prior approval by the NDIC. The proposed directional
plan is at a legal location. Based on the azimuth of the proposed lateral the maximum legal coordinate from the well head is: 9972’E.

Location Construction Commencement (Three Day Waiting Period)

Operators shall not commence operations on a drill site until the 3rd business day following publication of the approved drilling permit
on the NDIC - OGD Daily Activity Report. If circumstances require operations to commence before the 3rd business day following
publication on the Daily Activity Report, the waiting period may be waived by the Director. Application for a waiver must be by sworn
affidavit providing the information necessary to evaluate the extenuating circumstances, the factors of NDAC 43-02-03-16.2 (1), (a)-(f), and
any other information that would allow the Director to conclude that in the event another owner seeks revocation of the drilling permit,
the applicant should retain the permit.

Permit Fee & Notification

Payment was received in the amount of $100 via credit card .The permit fee has been received. It is requested that notification be given
immediately upon the spudding of the well. This information should be relayed to the Oil & Gas Division, Bismarck, via telephone. The
following information must be included: Well name, legal location, permit number, drilling contractor, company representative, date and
time of spudding. Office hours are 8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. Central Time. Our telephone number is (701) 328-

NOTE: A Gamma Ray log must be run to ground surface and a CBL must be run on intermediate or longstring casing string if set.

Surveys are required at least every 30 feet in the build section and every 90 feet in the lateral section of a horizontal well. Measurement
inaccuracies are not considered when determining compliance with the spacing/drilling unit boundary setback requirement except in the
following scenarios: 1) When the angle between the well bore and the respective boundary is 10 degrees or less; or 2) If Industry standard
methods and equipment are not utilized. Consult the applicable field order for exceptions.

If measurement inaccuracies are required to be considered, a 2° MWD measurement inaccuracy will be applied to the horizontal portion of the well
bore. This measurement inaccuracy is applied to the well bore from KOP to TD.

RE: Filter Socks and Other Filter Media
Leakproof Container Required
Oil and Gas Wells

Dear Operator,

North Dakota Administrative Code Section 43-02-03-19.2 states in part that all waste material associated with
exploration or production of oil and gas must be properly disposed of in an authorized facility in accord with all
applicable local, state, and federal laws and regulations.

Filtration systems are commonly used during oil and gas operations in North Dakota. The Commission is very
concerned about the proper disposal of used filters (including filter socks) used by the oil and gas industry.

Effective June 1, 2014, a container must be maintained on each well drilled in North Dakota beginning when the
well is spud and must remain on-site during clean-out, completion, and flow-back whenever filtration operations
are conducted. The on-site container must be used to store filters until they can be properly disposed of in an
authorized facility. Such containers must be:

e leakproof to prevent any fluids from escaping the container

e covered to prevent precipitation from entering the container

e placard to indicate only filters are to be placed in the container

If the operator will not utilize a filtration system, a waiver to the container requirement will be considered, but
only upon the operator submitting a Sundry Notice (Form 4) justifying their request.

As previously stated in our March 13, 2014 letter, North Dakota Administrative Code Section 33-20-02.1-01
states in part that every person who transports solid waste (which includes oil and gas exploration and production
wastes) is required to have a valid permit issued by the North Dakota Department of Health, Division of Waste
Management. Please contact the Division of Waste Management at (701) 328-5166 with any questions on the
solid waste program. Note oil and gas exploration and production wastes include produced water, drilling mud,
invert mud, tank bottom sediment, pipe scale, filters, and fly ash.

Thank you for your cooperation.

Sincerely,

Brace E. Fichs

Brandi,

The pad layout states “Pit Will Be Offsite” and there is not pit shown on the pad. Therefore, we
need to know where the cuttings are going.

Thanks,
Alice

Good morning Brandi,
Could you please tell me what facility the cuttings will be hauled to from this pad?
Also, since the lateral penetrates BLM lands has Oasis requested the appropriate permit(s)?

Thanks,
Alice
