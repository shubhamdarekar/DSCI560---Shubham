# Laboratory Assignment 1 


## Problem Statement 
This is the first assignment of the course that focuses on helping you get your systems set up, finish required installations, and run a few basic tasks. We will use virtual machines (VM) or containers with Linux as the operating system and Python as the programming language for the entire course. In this assignment, you will install and set up the Ubuntu Linux VM and install the required software packages for Python. You will run a few tasks on Linux Terminal and Python tasks to get hands-on experience. You are expected to submit a document with snapshots and a few lines of description for each task performed as a part of the assignment. Please ensure that the script files you submit have proper comments.

## How to run Application Locally
1. Clone the GitHub Project
2. Install python and the requirements
3. Run the files in script folder

## Code details
1. Scrape Data => Using a headless Chromium browser using Selenium, it navigates to the news website waits for 5 seconds to let the website load and parses the HTML content using Beautiful Soup. The code writes the data in raw data folder
2. Filter Data => It reads the data from previously written html file. We parse the data from BeautifulSoup and uses three function, extract_market_data to get market data into dictionary, extract_latest_news to get the news data in dictionary and convert_to_csv to convert and write to csv files.
