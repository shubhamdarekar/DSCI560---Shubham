# Laboratory Assignment 1 


## Problem Statement 
This is the first assignment of the course that focuses on helping you get your systems set up, finish required installations, and run a few basic tasks. We will use virtual machines (VM) or containers with Linux as the operating system and Python as the programming language for the entire course. In this assignment, you will install and set up the Ubuntu Linux VM and install the required software packages for Python. You will run a few tasks on Linux Terminal and Python tasks to get hands-on experience. You are expected to submit a document with snapshots and a few lines of description for each task performed as a part of the assignment. Please ensure that the script files you submit have proper comments.
